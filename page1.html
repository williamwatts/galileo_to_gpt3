      <td><b><i><font size="+1">TO THE DISCERNING READER</font></i></b>
      <p><i><font face="Times"><font size="-0">Several years ago there
was published
in Rome a salutary edict which, in order to obviate the dangerous
tendencies
of our present age, imposed a seasonable silence upon the Pythagorean
opinion
that the earth moves There were those who impudently asserted that this
decree had its origin not injudicious inquire, but in passion none too
well informed Complaints were to be heard that advisers who were
totally
unskilled at astronomical observations ought not to clip the wings of
reflective
intellects by means of rash prohibitions.</font></font></i> </p>
      <p><i><font face="Times"><font size="-0">Upon hearing such
carping insolence,
my zeal could not be contained. Being thoroughly informed about that
prudent
determination, I decided to appear openly in the theater of the world
as
a witness of the sober truth. I was at that time in Rome; I was not
only
received by the most eminent prelates of that Court, but had their
applause;
indeed this decree was not published without some previous notice of it
having been given to me. Therefore I propose in the present work to
show
to foreign nations that as much is understood of this matter in Italy,
and particularly in Rome, as transalpine diligence can ever have
imagined
Collecting all the reflections that properly concern the Copernican
system,
I shall make it known that everything was brought before the attention
of the Roman censorship, and that there proceed from this clime not
only
dogmas for the welfare of the soul, but ingenious discoveries for the
delight
of the mind as well.</font></font></i> </p>
      <p><i><font face="Times"><font size="-0">To this end I have taken
the Copernican
side in the discourse, proceeding as with a pure mathematical
hypothesis
and striving by every artipee to represent it as superior to supposing
the earth motionless&#8211;not, indeed absolutely, but as against the
arguments
of some professed Peripatetics.</font></font></i> <i><font face="Times"><font
 size="-0">These
men indeed deserve not even that name, for they do not walk about; they
are content to adore the shadows, philosophizing not with due
circumspection
but merely from having memorized a few ill-understood principles.</font></font></i>
      </p>
      <p><i><font face="Times"><font size="-0">Three principal headings
are treated
First, I shall try to show that all experiments practicable upon the
earth
are insufficient measures for proving its mobility, since they are
indiferently
adaptable to an earth in motion or at rest. I hope in so doing to
reveal
many observations unknown to the ancients. Secondly, the celestial
phenomena
will be examined strengthening the Copernican hypothesis until it might
seem that this must triumph absolutely. Here new reflections are
adjoined
which might be used in order to simplfy astronomy, though not because
of
any necessity imported by nature. In the third place, I shall
propose
an ingenious speculation. It happens that long ago I said that the
unsolved
problem of the ocean tides might receive some light from assuming the
motion
of the earth. This assertion of mine, passing by word of mouth, found
loving
fathers who adopted it as a child of their own ingenuity. Now, so that
no stranger may ever a who, arming himself with our weapons, shall
charge
us with want of attention to such an important matter, I have thought
it
good to reveal those probabilities which might render this plausible,
given
that the earth moves.</font></font></i> </p>
      <p><i><font face="Times"><font size="-0">I hope that from these
considerations
the world will come to know that if other nations have navigated more,
we have not theorized less. It is not from failing to take count of
what
others have thought that we have yielded to asserting that the earth is
motionless, and holding the contrary to be a mere mathematical caprice,
but (if for nothing else) for those reasons that are supplied by piety,
religion, the knowledge of Divine Omnipotence, and a consciousness of
the
limitations of the human mind I have thought it most appropriate to
explain
these concepts in the form of dialogues, which, no! being restricted to
the rigorous observance of mathematical laws, make room also for
digressions
which are sometimes no less interesting than the principal argument.</font></font></i>
      </p>
      <p><i><font face="Times"><font size="-0">Many years ago I was
often to be
found in the marvelous city of Venice, in discussions with Signore
Giovanni
Francesco Sagredo, a man of noble extraction and trenchant wit. Prom
Florence
came Signore Filippo Salviati, the least of whose glories were the
eminence
of his blood and the magnificence of his fortune. His was a sublime
intellect
which fed no more hungrily upon any pleasure than it did upon fine
meditations.
I often talked with these two of such matters in the presence of a
certain
Peripatetic philosopher whose greatest obstacle in apprehending the
truth
seemed to be the reputation he had acquired by his interpretations of
Aristotle.</font></font></i> </p>
      <p><i><font face="Times"><font size="-0">Now, since bitter death
has deprived
Venice and Florence of those two great luminaries in the very meridian
of their years, I have resolved to make their fame live on in these
pages,
so far as my poor abilities will permit, by introducing them as
interlocutors
in the present argument. (Nor shall the good Peripatetic lack a place;
because of his excessive affection toward the Commentaries of
Simplicius,I
have thought fit to leave him under the name of the author he so much
revered,
without mentioning his own) May it please those two great souls, ever
venerable
to my heart, to accept this public monument of my undying love. And may
the memory of their eloquence assist me in delivering to posterity the
promised reflections.</font></font></i> </p>
      <p><i><font face="Times"><font size="-0">It happened that several
discussions
had taken place casually at various times among these gentlemen, and
had
rather whetted than satisfied their thirst for learning. Hence very
wisely
they resolved to meet together on certain days during which, setting
aside
all other business, they might apply themselves more methodically to
the
contemplation of the wonders of God in the heavens and upon the earth.
They
met in the palace of the illustrious Sagredo; and, after the customary
but brief exchange of compliments, Saiviati commenced as follows.</font></font></i>

      <center>
      <h3>SALVIATI, SAGRFDO, AND SIIMPLICIO</h3>
      </center>
      <b>SALVIATI.</b> Yesterday we resolved to meet today and discuss
as clearly
and in as much detail as possible the character and the efficacy of
those
laws of nature which up to the present have been put forth by the
partisans
of the Aristotelian and Ptolemaic position on the one hand, and by the
followers of the Copemican system on the other. Since Copernicus places
the earth among the movable heavenly bodies, making it a globe like a
planet,
we may well begin our discussion by examining the Peripatetic steps in
arguing the impossibility of that hypothesis; what they are, and how
great
is their force and effect. For this it is necessary to introduce into
nature
two substances which differ essentially. These are the celestial and
the
elemental, the former being invariant and eternalo the latter,
temporary
and destructible. This argument Aristotle treats in his book <i>De
Caelo</i>,
introducing it with some discourses dependent upon certain general
assumptions,
and afterwards confirming it by experiments and specific
demonstrations.
Following the same method, I shall first propound, and then freely
speak
my opinion, submitting myself to your criticisms -- particularly those
of Simplicio, that stout champion and defender of Aristotelian
doctrines.
      <p>The first step in the Peripatetic arguments is Aristotle's
proof of
the completeness and perfection of the world. For, he tells us, it is
not
a mere line, nor a bare surface, but a body having length, breadth, and
depth. Since there are only these three dimensions, the world, having
these,
has them all, and, having the Whole, is perfect. To be sure, I much
wish
that Aristotle had proved to me by rigorous deductions that simple
length
constitutes the dimension which we call a line, which by the addition
of
breadth becomes a surface; that by further adding altitude or depth to
this there results a body, and that after these three dimensions there
is no passing farther, so that by these three alone, completeness, or,
so
to speak, wholeness is concluded. Especially since he might have done
so
very plainly and speedily. </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> What about the elegant demonstrations in the
second, third,
and fourth texts, after the definition of "continuous"? Is it not there
first proved that there are no more than three dimensions, since Three
is everything, and everywhere? And is this not confirmed by the
doctrine
and authority of the Pythagoreans, who say that all things are
determined
by three -- beginning, middle, and end -- which is the number of the
Whole?
Also, why leave out another of his reasons; namely, that this number is
used, as if by a law of nature, in sacrifices to the gods? Furthermore,
is it not dictated by nature that we attribute the title of "all" to
those
things that are three, and not less? For two are called "both," and one
does not say "all" unless there are three. </p>
      <p>You have all this doctrine in the second text. Afterwards, in
the third
we read, for greater knowledge that All, and Whole, and Perfect are
formally
one and the same; and that therefore among figures only the solid is
complete.
For it alone is determined by three, which is All; and, being divisible
in three ways, it is divisible in every possible way. Of the other
figures,
one is divisible in one way, and the other in two, because they have
their
divisibility and their continuity according to the number of dimensions
allotted to them. Thus one figure is continuous in one way, the other
in
two; but the third, namely the solid, is so in every way. </p>
      <p>Moreover, in the fourth text, after some other doctrines, does
he not
clinch the matter with another proof? To wit: a transition is made only
according to some defect; thus there is a transition in passing from
the
line to the surface, because the line is lacking in breadth. But it is
impossible for the perfect to lack anything, being complete in every
way;
therefore there is no transition beyond the solid or body to any other
figure. </p>
      <p>Do you not think that in all these places he has sufficiently
proved
that there is no passing beyond the three dimensions, length, breadth,
and thickness; and that therefore the body, or solid, which has them
all,
is perfect? </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> To tell you the truth, I do not feel impelled by
all these
reasons to grant any more than this: that whatever has a beginning,
middle,
and end may and ought to be called perfect. I feel no compulsion to
grant
that the number three is a perfect number, nor that it has a faculty of
conferring perfection upon its possessors. I do not even understand,
let
alone believe, that with respect to legs, for example, the number three
is more perfect than four or two; neither do I conceive the number four
to be any imperfection in the elements, nor that they would be more
perfect
if they were three. Therefore it would have been better for him to
leave
these subtleties to the rhetoricians, and to prove his point by
rigorous
demonstrations such as are suitable to make in the demonstrative
sciences. </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> It seems that you ridicule these reasons, and yet
all of
them are doctrines to the Pythagoreans, who attribute so much to
numbers.
You, who are a mathematician, and who believe many Pythagorean
philosophical
opinions, now seem to scorn their mysteries. </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> That the Pythagoreans held the science of the
human understanding
and believed it to partake of divinity simply because it understood the
nature of numbers, I know very well; nor am I far from being of the
same
opinion. But that these mysteries which caused Pythagoras and his sect
to have such veneration for the science of numbers are the follies that
abound in the sayings and Writings of the vulgar, I do not believe at
all.
Rather I know that, in order to prevent the things they admired from
being
exposed to the slander and scorn of the common people, the Pythagoreans
condemned as sacrilegious the publication of the most hidden properties
of numbers or of the incommensurable and irrational quantities which
they
investigated. They taught that anyone who had revealed them was
tormented
in the other world. Therefore I believe that some one of them, just to
satisfy the common sort and free himself from their inquisitiveness,
gave
it out that the mysteries of numbers were those trifles which later
spread
among the vulgar. Such astuteness and prudence remind one of the wise
young
man who, in order to stop the importunity of his mother or his
inquisitive
wife -- I forget which -- who pressed him to impart the secrets of the
Senate, made up some story which afterwards caused her and many other
women
to be the laughing-stock of that same Senate.&nbsp; </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> I do not want to join the number of those who are
too curious
about the Pythagorean mysteries. But as to the point in hand, I reply
that
the reasons produced by Aristotle to prove that there are not and
cannot
be more than three dimensions seem to me conclusive; and I believe that
if a more cogent demonstration had existed, Aristotle would not have
omitted
it. </p>
      <p><b>SAGR.</b> You might at least add, "if he had known it or if
it had
occurred to him." Salviati, you would be doing me a great favor by
giving
me some effective arguments. if there are any clear enough to be
comprehended
by me. </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> Not only by you, but by Simplicio too; and not
merely comprehended,
but already known -- though perhaps without your realizing it. And to
make
them easier to understand, let us take this paper and pen which I see
already
prepared for such occasions, and draw a few figures. </p>
      <p>First we shall mark these two points, A and B, and draw from
one to
the other the curved lines ACB and ADE, and the straight line P3. (Fig.
1) I ask which of them is to your mind the one that determines the
distance
between the ends A and B, and why? </p>
      <center><img src="7.1.fig1-2.gif" alt="" align="left" border="0"
 height="126" hspace="1" vspace="10" width="274"></center>
      <p><b>SAGR.</b> I should say the straight line, and not the
curves, because
the straight one is shorter and because it is unique, distinct, and
determinate;
the infinite others are indefinite, unequal, and longer. It seems to me
that the choice ought to depend upon that which is unique and
definite.&nbsp; </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> We have the straight line, then, as determining
the distance
between the two points. We now add another straight line parallel to AB
-- let it be CD -- so that between them there lies a surface of which I
want you to show the breadth. (Fig. 2) Therefore starting from point A,
tell me how and which way you will go, stopping on the line CD, so as
to
show me the breadth included between those lines. Would you determine
it
according to the measure of the curve AF, or the straight line AF, or.
. . ?&nbsp; </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> According to the straight line AF, and not
according to
the curve, such being already excluded for such a use. </p>
      <p><b>SAGR.</b> But I should take neither of them, seeing that
the straight
line AF runs obliquely. I should draw a line perpendicular to CD, for
this
would seem to me to be the shortest, as well as being unique among the
infinite number of longer and unequal ones which may be drawn from the
point A to every other point of the opposite line CD.&nbsp; </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> Your choice and the reason you adduce for it seem
to me
most excellent. So now we have it that the first dimension is
determined
by a straight line; the second (namely, breadth) by another straight
line,
and not only straight, but at right angles to that which determines the
length. Thus we have defined the two dimensions of a surface; that is,
length and breadth. </p>
      <p>But suppose you had to determine a height -- for example, how
high this
platform is from the pavement down below there. Seeing that from any
point
in the platform we may draw infinite lines, curved or straight, and all
of different lengths, to the infinite points of the pavement below,
which
of all these lines would you make use of? </p>
      <p><b>SAGR.</b> I would fasten a string to the platform and, by
hanging
a plummet from it, would let it freely stretch till it reached very
near
to the pavement; the length of such a string being the straightest and
shortest of all the lines that could possibly be drawn from the same
point
to the pavement, I should say that it was the true height in this case.
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> Very good. And if, from the point on the pavement
indicated
by this hanging string (taking the pavement to be level and not
inclined),
you should produce two other straight lines, one for the length and the
other for the breadth of the surface of the pavement, what angles would
they make with the thread? </p>
      <p><b>SAGR.</b> They would surely meet at right angles, since the
string
falls perpendicularly and the pavement is quite flat and level. </p>
      <p><b>SALV </b>Therefore if you assign any point for the point
of origin
of your measurements, and from that produce a straight line as the
determinant
of the first measurement (that is, of the length) it will necessarily
follow
that the one which is to define the breadth leaves the first at a right
angle. That which is to denote the altitude, which is the third
dimension,
going out from the same point, also forms right angles and not oblique
angles with the other two. And thus by three perpendiculars you will
have
determined the three dimensions AB length, AC breadth, and AD height,
by three unique, definite, and shortest lines.
(Fig. 3) And since clearly no more lines can meet in the said point to
make right angles with them, and the dimensions must be determined by
the
only straight lines which make right angles with each other, then the
dimensions
are no more than three; and whatever has the three has all of them, and
that which has all of them is divisible in every way, and that which is
so, is perfect, etc.&nbsp; </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> Who says that I cannot draw other lines? Why may
I not
bring another line from beneath to the point A, which will be
perpendicular
to the rest? </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> Surely you cannot make more than three straight
lines meet
in the same point and form right angles with each other! </p>
      <p><b>SAGR.</b> Yes, because it seems to me that what Simphcio
means would
be the same DA prolonged downward. In that way there might also be
drawn
two others; but they would be the same as the first three, differing
only
in that whereas now they merely touch, they would then intersect. But
this
would not produce any new dimensions. </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> I shall not say that this argument of yours
cannot be conclusive.
But I still say, with Aristotle, that in physical matters one need not
always require a mathematical demonstration. </p>
      <p><b>SAGR. </b>Granted, where none is to be had; but when there
is one
at hand, why do you not wish to use it? But it would be good to spend
no
more words on this point, for I think that Salviati will have conceded
both to Aristotle and to you, without further demonstration, that the
world
is a body, and perfect; yea, most perfect, being the chief work of God.
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> Exactly so. Therefore leaving the general
contemplation
of the whole, let us get to the consideration of the pans. Aristotle in
his first division separates the whole into two differing and, in a
way,
contrary parts: namely, the celestial and the elemental, the former
being
ingenerable, incorruptible, inalterable, impenetrable, etc.; the
latter
being exposed to continual alteration, mutation, etc. He takes this
difference
from the diversity of local motions as his original principle. With
this
step he proceeds. </p>
      <p>Leaving, so to speak, the sensible world and retiring into the
ideal
world, he begins architectonically to consider that, nature being the
principle of motion, it is appropriate that natural bodies should be
endowed
with local motion. He then declares local motions to be of three kinds:
namely, circular, straight, and mixed straight-and-circular. The first
two he calls simple, because of all lines only the circular and the
straight
are simple. Hereupon, restricting himself somewhat, he newly defines
among
the simple motions one, the circular, to be that which is made around
the
center; and the other, the straight, to be upward and downward --
upward,
that which goes from the center; and downward, whatever goes toward the
center. And from this he infers it to be necessary and proper that all
simple motions are confined to these three kinds; namely, toward the
center,
away from the center, and around the center. This answers, he says,
with
a certain beautiful harmony to what has been said previously about the
body; it is perfect in three things, and its motion is likewise. <br>
These motions being established, he goes on to say that some natural
bodies being simple, and others composites of those (and he calls those
bodies simple which have a natural principle of motion, such as fire
and
earth), it is proper that simple motions should be those of simple
bodies,
and that mixed motions should belong to compound bodies; in such a way,
moreover, that compounds take the motion of that part which
predominates
in their composition. </p>
      <p><b>SAGR.</b> Wait awhile, Salviati, for in this argument I
find so many
doubts assailing me on all sides that I shall either have to tell them
to you if I want to pay attention to what you are going to say, or
withhold
my attention in order to remember my doubts. </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> I shall willingly pause, for I run the same risk
too, and
am on the verge of getting shipwrecked. At present I sail between rocks
and boisterous waves that are making me lose my bearings, as they say.
Therefore, before I multiply your difficulties, propound them. </p>
      <center>
      <p><b><i>[Discussion of earth's place in the solar system:]</i></b></p>
      </center>
      <p><b>SALV. </b>I see we are once more going to engulf ourselves
in a boundless
sea from which there is no getting out, ever. This is navigating
without
compass, stars, oars, or rudder, in which we must needs either pass
from
bank to bank or run aground, or sail forever lost. If, as you
suggested,
we are to get on with our main subject, it is necessary for the present
to put aside the general question whether straight motion is necessary
in nature and is proper to some bodies, and proceed to demonstrations,
observations, and particular experiments. First we must propound all
those
that have been put forward to prove the earth's stability by Aristotle,
Ptolemy, and others, trying next to resolve them. Finally we must
produce
those by which a person may become persuaded that the earth, no less
than
the moon or any other planet, is to be numbered among the natural
bodies
that move circularly. </p>
      <p><b>SAGR. </b>I submit to the latter more willingly, as I am
better satisfied
with your architectonic and general discourse than with that of
Aristotle.
For yours satisfies me without the least misgiving, while the other
blocks
me in some way at every turn. Nor do I know why Simplicio should not be
quickly satisfied with the argument you put forward to prove that
motion
in a straight line can have no place in nature, so long as we suppose
the
parts of the universe to be disposed in the best arrangement and
perfectly
ordered.&nbsp; </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> Stop there, Sagredo. for now a way occurs to me
in which
Simplicio may be given satisfaction, provided only that he does not
wish
to stay so closely tied to every phrase of Aristotle's as to hold it
sacrilege
to depart from a single one of them. </p>
      <p>There is no doubt that to maintain the optimum placement and
perfect
order of the parts of the universe as to local situation, nothing will
do but circular motion or rest. As to motion by a straight line, I do
not
see how it can be of use for anything except to restore to their
natural
location such integral bodies as have been accidentally removed and
separated
from their whole, as we have just said. </p>
      <p>Let us now consider the whole terrestrial globe, and let us
see what
can happen to make it and the other world bodies keep themselves in the
natural and best disposition. One must either say that it is at rest
and
remains perpetually immovable in its place, or else that it stays
always
in its place but revolves itself, or finally that it goes about a
center,
moving along the circumference of a circle. Of these events, Aristotle
and Ptolemy and all their followers say that it is the first which has
always been observed and which will be forever maintained; that is,
perpetual
rest in the same place. Now why, then, should they not have said from
the
start that its natural property is to remain motionless, rather than
making
its natural motion downward, a motion with which it never did and never
will move? And as to motion by a straight line, let it be granted to us
that nature makes use of this to restore particles of earth, water,
air,
fire, and every other integral mundane body to their whole, when any of
them find themselves separated and transported into some improper place
unless this restoration can also be made by finding some more
appropriate
circular motion. It seems to me that this original position fits all
the
consequences much better, even by Aristotle's own method, than to
attribute
straight motion as an intrinsic and natural principle of the elements.
This is obvious; for let me ask the Peripatetic if, being of the
opinion
that celestial bodies are incorruptible and eternal, he believes that
the
terrestrial globe is not so, but corruptible and mortal, so that there
will come a time when, the sun and moon and other stars continuing
their
existence and their operations, the earth will not be found in the
universe
but will be annihilated along with the rest of the elements, and I am
certain
that he would answer, No. Therefore generation and corruption belong to
the parts and not to the whole; indeed, to very small and superficial
parts
which are insensible in comparison to the whole mass. Now since
Aristotle
argues generation and corruption from the contrariety of straight
motions,
let us grant such motions to the parts, which alone change and decay.
But
to the whole globe and sphere of the elements will be ascribed either
circular
motion or perpetual continuance in its proper place -- the only
tendencies
fined for the perpetuation and maintenance of perfect order. </p>
      <p>What is thus said of earth may be said as reasonably of fire
and of
the greater part of the air, to which elements the Peripatetics are
forced
to assign as an intrinsic and natural motion one with which they were
never
moved and never will be, and to abolish from nature that motion with
which
they move, have moved, and are to be moved perpetually. I say this
because
they assign an upward motion to air and fire, which is a motion that
never
belongs to the said elements, but only to some of their particles --
and
even then only to restore them to perfect arrangement when they are out
of their natural places. On the other hand, they call circular motion
(with
which they are incessantly moved) preternatural to them, forgetting
what
Aristotle has said many times, that nothing violent can last very long.
      </p>
      <p><b>SIMP. </b>To all these things we have the most suitable
answers,
which I omit for the present in order that we may come to the
particular
reasons and sensible experiments which ought to be finally preferred,
as
Aristotle well says, above anything that can be supplied by human
argument. </p>
      <p><b>SAGR.</b> Then what has been said up to now will serve to
place under
consideration which of two general arguments has the more probability.
First there is that of Aristotle, who would persuade us that sublunar
bodies
are by nature generable and corruptible, etc., and are therefore very
different
in essence from celestial bodies, these being invariant, ingenerable,
incorruptible,
etc. This argument is deduced from differences of simple motions.
Second
is that of Salviati, who assumes the integral parts of the world to be
disposed in the best order, and as a necessary consequence excludes
straight
motions for simple natural bodies as being of no use in nature; he
takes
the earth to be another of the celestial bodies, endowed with all the
prerogatives
that belong to them. The latter reasoning suits me better up to this
point
than the other. Therefore let Simplicio be good enough to produce all
the
specific arguments, experiments, and observations, both physical and
astronomical,
by which one may be fully persuaded that the earth differs from the
celestial
bodies, is immovable, and is located in the center of the universe, or
anything else that would exclude the earth from being movable like a
planet
such as Jupiter, or the moon, etc. And you, Salviati, have the kindness
to reply step by step. </p>
      <p><b>SIMP. </b>For a beginning, then, here are two powerful
demonstrations
proving the earth to be very different from celestial bodies. First,
bodies
that are generable corruptible, alterable, etc., are quite different
from
those that are ingenerable, incorruptible, inalterable, etc. The earth
is generable, corruptible, alterable, etc., while celestial bodies are
ingenerable, incorruptible, inalterable, etc. Therefore the earth is
very
different from the celestial bodies. </p>
      <p><b>SAGR.</b> With your first argument, you bring back to the
table what
has been standing there all day and has just now been carried away. </p>
      <p><b>SIMIP.</b> Softly, sir; hear the rest, and you will see how
different
it is from that. Formerly the minor premise was proved <i>a priori</i>,
and now I wish to prove it <i>a posteriori</i>. See for yourself
whether
this is the same thing. I shall prove the minor, because the major is
obvious. </p>
      <p>Sensible experience shows that on earth there are continual
generations,
corruptions, alter-ations, etc., the like of which neither our senses
nor
the traditions or memories of our ancestors have ever detected in
heaven;
hence heaven is inalterable, etc., and the earth alterable, etc., and
therefore
different from the heavens. </p>
      <p>The second argument I take from a principal and essential
property,
which is this: whatever body is naturally dark and devoid of light is
different
from luminous and resplendent bodies; the earth is dark and without
light,
and celestial bodies are splendid and full of light; therefore, etc.
Answer
these, so that too great a pile does not accumulate, and then I will
add
others. </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> As to the first, for whose force you appeal to
experience,
I wish you would tell me precisely what these alterations are that you
see on the earth and not in the heavens, and on account of which you
call
the earth alterable and the heavens not. </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> On earth I continually see herbs, plants, animals
generating
and decaying; winds, rains, tempests, storms arising; in a word, the
appearance
of the earth undergoing perpetual change. None of these changes are to
be discerned in celestial bodies, whose positions and configurations
correspond
exactly with everything men remember, without the generation of
anything
new there or the corruption of anything old. </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> But if you have to content yourself with these
visible,
or rather these seen experiences, you must consider China and America
celestial
bodies, since you surely have never seen in them these alterations
which
you see in Italy. Therefore, in your sense, they must be inalterable. </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> Even if I have never seen such alterations in
those places
with my own senses, there are reliable accounts of them; besides which,
      <i>cum
eadem sit ratio totius et partium</i><font size="-1">, </font>those
counties
being a pan of the earth like ours, they must be alterable like this. </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> But why have you not observed this, instead of
reducing
yourself to having to believe the tales of others? Why not see it with
your own eyes? </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> Because those countries are far from being
exposed to view;
they are so distant that our sight could not discover such alterations
in them. </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> Now see for yourself how you have inadvertently
revealed
the fallacy of your argument. You say that alterations which may be
seen
near at hand on earth cannot be seen in America because of the great
distance.
Well, so much the less could they be seen in the moon, which is many
hundreds
of times more distant. And if you believe in alterations in Mexico on
the
basis of news from there, what reports do you have from the moon to
convince
you that there are no alterations there? From your not seeing
alterations
in heaven (where if any occurred you would not be able to see them by
reason
of the distance, and from whence no news is to be had), you cannot
deduce
that there are none, in the same way as from seeing and recognizing
them
on earth you correctly deduce that they do exist here. </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> Among the changes that have taken place on earth
I can
find some so great that if they had occurred on the moon they could yen
well have been observed here below. From the oldest records we have it
that formerly, at the Straits of Gibraltar, Abila and Calpe were joined
together with some lesser mountains which held the ocean in check; but
these mountains being separated by some cause, the opening admitted the
sea, which flooded in so as to form the Mediterranean. When we consider
the immensity of this, and the difference in appearance which must have
been made in the water and land seen from afar, there is no doubt that
such a change could easily have been seen by anyone then on the moon.
Just
so would the inhabitants of earth have discovered any such alteration
in
the moon; yet there is no history of such a thing being seen. Hence
there
remains no basis for saying that anything in the heavenly bodies is
alterable,
etc. </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> I do not make bold to say that such great changes
have
taken place in the moon, but neither am I sure that they could not have
happened. Such a mutation could be represented to us only by some
variation
between the lighter and the darker parts of the moon, and I doubt
whether
we have had observant selenographers on earth who have for any
considerable
number of years provided us with such exact selenography as would make
us reasonably conclude that no such change has come about in the face
of
the moon. Of the moon's appearance, I find no more exact description
than
that some say it represents a human face; others, that it is like the
muzzle
of a lion; still others, that it is Cain with a bundle of thorns on his
back. So to say "Heaven is inalterable, because neither in the moon nor
in other celestial bodies are such alterations seen as are discovered
upon
the earth" has no power to prove anything. </p>
      <p><b>SAGR.</b> This first argument of Simplicio's leaves me with
another
haunting doubt which I should like to have removed. Accordingly I ask
him
whether the earth was generable and corruptible before the
Mediterranean
inundation, or whether it began to be so then? </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> It was without doubt generable and corruptible
before,
as well; but that was so vast a mutation that it might have been
observed
as far as the moon. </p>
      <p><b>SAGR.</b> Well, now; if the earth was generable and
corruptible before
that flood, why may not the moon be equally so without any such change?
Why is something necessary in the moon which means nothing on the
earth? </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> A very penetrating remark. But I am afraid that
Simplicio
is altering the meaning a bit in this text of Aristotle and the other
Peripatetics.
They say that they hold the heavens to be inalterable because not one
star
there has ever been seen to be generated or corrupted, such being
probably
a lesser part of heaven than a city is of the earth; yet innumerable of
the latter have been destroyed so that not a trace of them remains. </p>
      <p><b>SAGR.</b> Really, I thought otherwise, believing that
Simplicio distorted
this exposition of the text so that he might not burden the Master and
his disciples with a notion even more fantastic than the other. What
folly
it is to say, "The heavens are inalterable because stars are not
generated
or corrupted in them." Is there perhaps someone who has seen one
terrestrial
globe decay and another regenerated in its place? Is it not accepted by
all philosophers that very few stars in the heavens are smaller than
the
earth, while a great many are much bigger? So the decay of a star in
heaven
would be no less momentous than for the whole terrestrial globe to be
destroyed!
Now if, in order to be able to introduce generation and corruption into
the universe with certainty, it is necessary that as vast a body as a
star
must be corrupted and regenerated, then you had better give up the
whole
matter; for I assure you that you will never see the terrestrial globe
or any other integral body in the universe so corrupted that, after
having
been seen for many ages past, it dissolves without leaving a trace
behind. </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> But to give Simplicio more than satisfaction, and
to reclaim
him if possible from his error, I declare that we do have in our age
new
events and observations such that if Aristotle were now alive, I have
no
doubt he would change his opinion. This is easily inferred from his own
manner of philosophizing, for when he writes of considering the heavens
inalterable, etc., because no new thing is seen to be generated there
or
any old one dissolved, he seems implicitly to let us understand that if
he had seen any such event he would have reversed his opinion, and
properly
preferred the sensible experience to natural reason. Unless he had
taken
the senses into account, he would not have argued immutability from
sensible
mutations not being seen. </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> Aristotle first laid the basis of his argument <i>a
priori</i>,
showing the necessity of the inalterability of heaven by means of
natural,
evident, and clear principles. He afterward supported the same <i>a
posteriori</i>,
by the senses and by the traditions of the ancients. </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> What you refer to is the method he uses in
writing his
doctrine, but I do not believe it to be that with which he investigated
it. Rather, I think it certain that he first obtained it by means of
the
senses, experiments, and observations, to assure himself as much as
possible
of his conclusions. Afterward he sought means to make them
demonstrable.
That is what is done for the most part in the demonstrative sciences;
this
comes about because when the conclusion is true, one may by making use
of analytical methods hit upon some proposition which is already
demonstrated,
or arrive at some axiomatic principle; but if the conclusion is false,
one can go on forever without ever finding any known truth -- if indeed
one does not encounter some impossibility or manifest absurdity. And
you
may be sure that Pythagoras, long before he discovered the proof for
which
he sacrificed a hecatomb, was sure that the square on the side opposite
the right angle in a right triangle was equal to the squares on the
other
two sides. The certainty of a conclusion assists not a little in the
discovery
of its proof -- meaning always in the demonstrative sciences. But
however
Aristotle may have proceeded, whether the reason a priori came before
the
sense perception <i>a posteriori</i> or the other way round, it is
enough
that Aristotle, as he said many times, preferred sensible experience to
any argument. Besides, the strength of the arguments <i>a priori</i>
has
already been examined. </p>
      <p>Now, getting back to the subject, I say that things which are
being
and have been discovered in the heavens in our own time are such that
they
can give entire satisfaction to all philosophers, because just such
events
as we have been calling generations and corruptions have been seen and
are being seen in particular bodies and in the whole expanse of heaven.
Excellent astronomers have observed many comets generated and
dissipated
in places above the lunar orbit, besides the two new stars of 1572 and
1604, which were indisputably beyond all the planets. And on the face
of
the sun itself, with the aid of the telescope, they have seen produced
and dissolved dense and dark matter, appearing much like the clouds
upon
the earth: and many of these are so vast as to exceed not only the
Mediterranean
Sea, but all of Africa, with Asia thrown in. Now, if Aristotle had seen
these things, what do you think he would have said and done, Simplicio?
      </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> I do not know what would have been done or said
by Aristotle,
who was the master of all science, but I know to some extent what his
followers
do and say, and what they ought to do and say in order not to remain
without
a guide, a leader, and a chief in philosophy. </p>
      <p>As to the comets, have not these modem astronomers who wanted
to make
them celestial been vanquished by the <i>Anti-Tycho</i>? Vanquished,
moreover,
by their own weapons; that is, by means of parallaxes and of
calculations
turned about every which way, and finally concluding in favor of
Aristotle
that they are all elemental. A thing so fundamental to the innovators
having
been destroyed, what more remains to keep them on their feet? </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> Calm yourself, Simplicio. What does this modem
author of
yours say about the new stars of 1572 and 1604, and of the solar spots?
As far as the comets are concerned I, for my part, care little whether
they are generated below or above the moon, nor have I ever set much
store
by Tycho's verbosity. Neither do I feel any reluctance to believe that
their matter is elemental, and that they may rise as they please
without
encountering any obstacle from the impenetrability of the Peripatetic
heavens,
which I hold to be far more tenuous, yielding, and subtle than our air.
And as to the calculation of parallaxes, in the first place I doubt
whether
comets are subject to parallax; besides, the inconstancy of the
observations
upon which they have been computed renders me equally suspicious of
both
his opinions and his adversary's -- the more so because it seems to me
that the <i>Anti-Tycho</i> sometimes trims to its author's taste those
observations which do not suit his purposes, or else declares them to
be
erroneous. </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> With regard to the new stars, the <i>Anti-Tycho</i>
thoroughly
disposes of them in a few words, saying that such recent new stars are
not positively known to be heavenly bodies, and that if its adversaries
wish to prove any alterations and generations in the latter, they must
show us mutations made in stars which have already been described for a
long time and which are celestial objects beyond doubt. And this can
never
possibly be done. </p>
      <p>As to that material which some say is generated and dissolved
on the
face of the sun, no mention is made of it at all, from which I should
gather
that the author takes it for a fable, or for an illusion of the
telescope, <font size="-1">(note:
The telescope was an object of suspicion in many circles.) </font>or
at
best for some phenomenon produced by the air; in a word, for anything
but
celestial matter. </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> But you, Simplicio, what have you thought of to
reply to
the opposition of these importunate spots which have come to disturb
the
heavens, and worse still, the Peripatetic philosophy? It must be that
you,
as its intrepid defender, have found a reply and a solution which you
should
not deprive us of. </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> I have heard different opinions on this matter.
Some say,
"They are stars which, like Venus and Mercury, go about the sun in
their
proper orbits, and in passing under it present themselves to us as
dark;
and because there are many of them, they frequently happen to collect
together,
and then again to separate." Others believe them to be figments of the
air; still others, illusions of the lenses; and still others, other
things.
But I am most inclined to believe -- yes, I think it certain -- that
they
are a collection of various different opaque objects, coming together
almost
accidentally; and therefore we often see that in one spot there can be
counted ten or more such tiny bodies of irregular shape that look like
snowflakes, or tufts of wool, or flying moths. They change places with
each other, now separating and now congregating, but mostly right under
the sun, about which, as their center, they move. But it is not
therefore
necessary to say that they are generated or decay. Rather, they are
sometimes
hidden behind the body of the sun; at other times, though far from it,
they cannot be seen because of their proximity to its immeasurable
light.
For in the suns eccentric sphere there is established a sort of onion
composed
of various folds, one within another, each being studded with certain
little
spots, and moving; and although their movements seem at first to be
inconstant
and irregular. nonetheless it is said to be ultimately observed that
after
a certain time the same spots are sure to return. This seems to me to
be
the most appropriate expedient that has so far been found to account
for
such phenomena, and at the same time to maintain the incorruptibility
and
ingenerability of the heavens. And if this is not enough, there are
more
brilliant intellects who will find better answers. </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> If what we are discussing were a point of law or
of the
humanities, in which neither true nor false exists, one might trust in
subtlety of mind and readiness of tongue and in the greater experience
of the writers, and expect him who excelled in those things to make his
reasoning most plausible, and one might judge it to be the best. But in
the natural sciences, whose conclusions are true and necessary and have
nothing to do with human will, one must take care not to place oneself
in the defense of error; for here a thousand Demostheneses and a
thousand
Aristotles would be left in the lurch by every mediocre wit who
happened
to hit upon the truth for himself Therefore, Simplicio, give up this
idea
and this hope of yours that there may be men so much more leaned,
erudite,
and well-read than the rest of us as to he able to make that which is
false
become true in defiance of nature. And since among all opinions that
have
thus far been produced regarding the essence of sunspots, this one you
have just explained appears to you to be the correct one, it follows
that
all the rest are false. Now to free you also from that one -- which is
an utterly delusive chimera -- I shall, disregarding the many
improbabilities
in it, convey to you but two observed facts against it. </p>
      <p>One is that many of these spots are seen to originate in the
middle
of the solar disc, and likewise many dissolve and vanish far from the
edge
of the sun, a necessary argument that they must be generated and
dissolved.
For without generation and corruption, they could appear there only by
way of local motion, and they all ought to enter and leave by the very
edge. </p>
      <p>The other observation, for those not in the rankest ignorance
of perspective,
is that from the changes of shape observed in the spots, and from their
apparent changes in velocity, one must infer that the spots are in
contact
with the sun's body, and that, touching its surface, they are moved
either
with it or upon it and in no sense revolve in circles distant from it.
Their motion proves this by appearing to be very slow around the edge
of
the solar disc, and quite fast toward its center; the shapes of the
spots
prove the same by appearing very narrow around the sun's edge in
comparison
with how they look in the vicinity of the center. For around the center
they are seen in their majesty and as they really are; but around the
edge,
because of the curvature of the spherical surface, they show themselves
foreshortened. These diminutions of both motion and shape, for anyone
who
knows how to observe them and calculate diligently, correspond exactly
to what ought to appear if the spots are contiguous to the sun, and
hopelessly
contradict their moving in distant circles, or even at small intervals
from the solar body. This has been abundantly demonstrated by our
mutual
friend in his <i>Letters to Mark Welser on the Solar Spots</i>. It may
be inferred from the same changes of shape that none of these are stars
or other spherical bodies, because of all shapes only the sphere is
never
seen foreshortened, nor can it appear to be anything but perfectly
round.
So if any of the individual spots were a round body, as all stars are
deemed
to be, it would present the same roundness in the middle of the sun's
disc
as at the extreme edge, whereas they so much foreshorten and look so
thin
near that extremity, and &amp;e on the other hand so broad and long
toward
the center, as to make it certain that these are flakes of little
thickness
or depth with respect. to their length and breadth. </p>
      <p>Then as to its being observed ultimately that the same spots
are sure
to return after a certain period, do not believe that, Simplicio; those
who said that were trying to deceive you. That this is so, you may see
from their having said nothing to you about those that are generated or
dissolved on the face of the sun far from the edge; nor told you a word
about those which foreshorten, this being a necessary proof of their
contiguity
to the sun. The truth about the same spots returning is merely what is
written in the said <i>Letters;</i> namely, that some of them are
occasionally
of such long duration that they do not disappear in a single revolution
around the sun, which takes place in less than a month. </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> To tell the truth, I have not made such long and
careful
observations that I can qualify as an authority on the facts of this
matter;
but certainly I wish to do so, and then to see whether I can once more
succeed in reconciling what experience presents to us with what
Aristotle
teaches. For obviously two truths cannot contradict one another. </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> Whenever you wish to reconcile what your senses
show you
with the soundest teachings of Aristotle, you will have no trouble at
all.
Does not Aristotle say that because of the great distance, celestial
matters
cannot be treated very definitely? </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> He does say so, quite clearly. </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> Does he not also declare that what sensible
experience
shows ought to be preferred over any argument, even one that seems to
be
extremely well founded? And does he not say this positively and without
a bit of hesitation? </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> He does. </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> Then of the two propositions, both of them
Aristotelian
doctrines, the second -- which says it is necessary to prefer the
senses
over arguments -- is a more solid and definite doctrine than the other,
which holds the heavens to be inalterable. Therefore it is better
Aristotelian
philosophy to say "Heaven is alterable because my senses tell me so,"
than
to say, "Heaven is inalterable because Aristotle was so persuaded by
reasoning.
Add to this that we possess a better basis for reasoning about
celestial
things than Aristotle did. He admitted such perceptions to be very
difficult
for him by reason of the distance from his senses, and conceded that
one
whose senses could better represent them would be able to philosophize
about them with more certainty. Now we, thanks to the telescope, have
brought
the heavens thirty or forty times closer to us than they were to
Aristotle,
so that we can discern many things in them that he could not see; among
other things these sunspots, which were absolutely invisible to him.
Therefore
we can treat of the heavens and the sun more confidently than Aristotle
could. </p>
      <p><b>SAGR.</b> I can put myself in Simplicios place and see that
he is
deeply moved by the overwhelming force of these conclusive arguments.
But
seeing on the other hand the great authority that Aristotle has gained
universally; considering the number of famous interpreters who have
toiled
to explain his meanings; and observing that the other sciences, so
useful
and necessary to mankind, base a large pan of their value and
reputation
upon Aristotle's credit; Simplicio is confused and perplexed, and I
seem
to hear him say, "Who would there be to settle our controversies if
Aristotle
were to be deposed? What other author should we follow in the schools,
the academies, the universities? What philosopher has written the whole
of natural philosophy, so well arranged, without omitting a single
conclusion?
Ought we to desert that structure under which so many travelers have
recuperated?
Should we destroy that haven, that Prytaneum <font size="-1">(note:

public hall where statesmen, heroes, and dignitaries were honored and
entertained.)</font>
where so many scholars have taken refuge so comfortably; where, without
exposing themselves to the inclemencies of the air, they can acquire a
complete knowledge of the universe by merely turning over a few pages?
Should that fort be leveled where one may abide in safety against all
enemy
assaults?" </p>
      <p>I pity him no less than I should some fine gentleman who,
having built
a magnificent palace at great trouble and expense, employing hundreds
and
hundreds of artisans, and then beholding it threatened with ruin
because
of poor foundations, should attempt, in order to avoid the grief of
seeing
the walls destroyed, adorned as they are with so many lovely murals; or
the columns fall, which sustain the superb galleries, or the gilded
beams;
or the doors spoiled, or the pediments and the marble cornices, brought
in at so much cost -- should attempt, I say, to prevent the collapse
with
chains, props, iron bars, buttresses, and shores. </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> Well, Simplicio need not yet fear any such
collapse; I
undertake to insure him against damage at a much smaller cost. There is
no danger that such a multitude of great, subtle, and wise philosophers
will allow themselves to be overcome by one or two who bluster a bit.
Rather,
without even directing their pens against them, by means of silence
alone,
they place them in universal scorn and derision. It is vanity to
imagine
that one can introduce a new philosophy by refining this or that
author,
It is necessary first to teach the reform of the human mind and to
render
it capable of distinguishing truth from falsehood, which only God can
do. </p>
      <p>But where have we strayed, going from one argument to another?
I shall
not be able to get back to the path without guidance from your memory. </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> I remember quite well. We were dealing with the
reply of
the <i>Anti-Tycho</i> to the objections against the immutability of
the
heavens. Among these you brought in this matter of the sunspots, not
mentioned
by its author, and I believe you wished to give consideration to his
reply
in the case of the new stars. </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> Now I remember the rest. Continuing this subject,
it seems
to me that in the counter argument of the <i>Anti-Tycho</i> there are
some
things that ought to be criticized. First of all, if the two new stars,
which that author can do no less than place in the highest regions of
heaven,
and which existed a long time and finally vanished, caused him no
anxiety
about insisting upon the inalterability of heaven simply because they
were
not unquestionably parts of heaven or mutations in the ancient stars,
then
to what purpose does he make all this fuss and bother about getting the
comets away from the celestial regions at all costs? Would it not have
been enough for him to say that they are not unquestionably parts of
heaven
and not mutations in the ancient stars, and hence that they do not
prejudice
in any way either the heavens or the doctrines of Aristotle? </p>
      <p>In the second place I am not satisfied about his state of mind
when
he admits that any alterations which might be made in the stars would
be
destructive of the celestial prerogatives of incorruptibility, etc.,
since
the stars are celestial things, as is obvious and as everybody admits,
and when on the other hand he is not the least perturbed if the same
alterations
take place elsewhere in the expanse of heaven outside the stars
themselves.
Does he perhaps mean to imply that heaven is not a celestial thing? I
should
think that the stars were called celestial things because of their
being
in the heavens, or because of their being made of heavenly material,
and
that therefore the heavens would be even more celestial than they; I
could
not say similarly that anything was more terrestrial than earth itself,
or more igneous than fire. </p>
      <p>Next, his not having made mention of the sunspots, which are
conclusively
proved to be produced and dissolved and to be situated next to the body
of the sun and to revolve with it or in relation to it, gives me a good
indication that this author may write more for the comforting of others
than from his own convictions. I say this because he shows himself to
be
acquainted with mathematics, and it would be impossible for him not to
be convinced by the proofs that such material is necessarily contiguous
to the sun and undergoes generations and dissolutions so great that
nothing
of comparable size has ever occurred on earth. And if the generations
and
corruptions occurring on the very globe of the sun are so many, so
great,
and so frequent, while this can reasonably be called the noblest part
of
the heavens, then what argument remains that can dissuade us from
believing
that others take place on the other globes? </p>
      <p><b>SAGR.</b> I cannot without great astonishment -- I might
say without
great insult to my intelligence -- hear it attributed as a prime
perfection
and nobility of the natural and integral bodies of the universe that
they
are invariant, immutable, inalterable, etc., while on the other hand it
is called a great imperfection to be alterable, generable, mutable,
etc.
For my part I consider the earth very noble and admirable precisely
because
of the diverse alterations, changes, generations, etc. that occur in it
incessantly. If, not being subject to any changes, it were a vast
desert
of sand or a mountain of jasper, or if at the time of the flood the
waters
which covered it had frozen, and it had remained an enormous globe of
ice
where nothing was ever born or ever altered or changed, I should deem
it
a useless lump in the universe, devoid of activity and, in a word,
superfluous
and essentially nonexistent. This is exactly the difference between a
living
animal and a dead one; and I say the same of the moon, of Jupiter, and
of all other world globes. </p>
      <p>The deeper I go in considering the vanities of popular
reasoning, the
lighter and more foolish I find them. What greater stupidity can be
imagined
than that of calling jewels, silver, and gold "precious," and earth and
soil "base"? People who do this ought to remember that if there were as
great a scarcity of soil as of jewels or precious metals, there would
not
be a prince who would not spend a bushel of diamonds and rubies and a
cartload
of gold just to have enough earth to plant a jasmine in a little pot,
or
to sow an orange seed and watch it sprout, grow, and produce its
handsome
leaves, its fragrant flowers, and fine fruit. It is scarcity and plenty
that make the vulgar take things to be precious or worthless; they call
a diamond very beautiful because it is like pure water, and then would
not exchange one for ten barrels of water. Those who so greatly exalt
incorruptibility,
inalterability, etc. are reduced to talking this way, I believe, by
their
great desire to go on living, and by the terror they have of death.
They
do not reflect that if men were immortal, they themselves would never
have
come into the world. Such men really deserve to encounter a Medusa's
head
which would transmute them into statues of jasper or of diamond, and
thus
make them more perfect than they are. </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> Maybe such a metamorphosis would not be entirely
to their
disadvantage, for I think it would be better for them not to argue than
to argue on the wrong side. </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> Oh, there is no doubt whatever that the earth is
more perfect
the way it is, being alterable, changeable, etc., than it would be if
it
were a mass of stone or even a solid diamond, and extremely hard and
invariant.
But to the extent that these conditions bring nobility to the earth,
they
would render less perfect the celestial bodies, in which they would be
superfluous. For the celestial bodies -- that is, the sun, the moon,
and
the other stars, Which are ordained to have no other use than that of
service
to the earth -- need nothing more than motion and light to achieve
their
end. </p>
      <p><b>SAGR.</b> Has nature, then, produced and directed all these
enormous,
perfect, and most noble celestial bodies, invariant, eternal, and
divine.
for no other purpose than to serve the changeable, transitory, and
mortal
earth? To serve that which you call the dregs of the universe, the sink
of all uncleanness? Now to what purpose would the celestial bodies be
made
eternal, etc. in order to serve something transitory, etc.? Take away
this
purpose of serving the earth, and the innumerable host of celestial
bodies
is left useless and superfluous, since they have not and cannot have
any
reciprocal activities among themselves, all of them being inalterable,
immutable, and invariant. For instance, if the moon is invariant, how
would
you have the sun or any other star act upon it? The action would
doubtless
have no more effect than an attempt to melt a large mass of gold by
looking
at it or by thinking about it. Besides, it seems to me that at such
times
as the celestial bodies are contributing to the generations and
alterations
on the earth, they too must be alterable. Otherwise I do not see how
the
influence of the moon or sun in causing generations on the earth would
differ from placing a marble statue beside a woman and expecting
children
from such a union. </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> Corruptibility, alteration, mutation, etc. do not
pertain
to the whole terrestrial globe, which as to its entirety is no less
eternal
than the sun or moon. But as to its external parts it is generable and
corruptible, and it is certainly true that generations and corruptions
are perpetual in those parts, and, as perpetual, that they require
celestial
and eternal operations. Therefore it is necessary that celestial bodies
be eternal. </p>
      <p><b>SAGR.</b> This is all very well, but if there is nothing
prejudicial
to the immortality of the entire terrestrial globe in the
corruptibility
of its superficial pans, and if this generability, corruptibility,
alterability,
etc. give to it a great ornament and perfection, then why can you not
and
should you not likewise admit alterations, generations, etc. in the
external
parts of the celestial globes, adding these as an ornament without
diminishing
their perfection or depriving them of actions; even increasing those by
making them operative not only upon the earth but reciprocally among
themselves,
and the earth also upon them? </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> This cannot be, because the generations,
mutations, etc.
which would occur, say, on the moon, would be vain and useless, and
nature
makes nothing in vain. </p>
      <p><b>SAGR.</b> And why should they be vain and useless? </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> Because we plainly see and feel that all
generations, changes,
etc. that occur on earth are either directly or indirectly designed for
the use, comfort, and benefit of man. Horses are born to accommodate
men;
for the nutriment of horses, the earth produces hay and the clouds
water
it. For the comfort and nourishment of men are created herbs, cereals,
fruits, beasts, birds, and fishes. In brief, if we proceed to examine
and
weigh carefully all these things, we shall find that the goal toward
which
all are directed is the need, the use, the comfort and the delight of
men.
Now of what use to the human race could generations ever be which might
happen on the moon or other planets? Unless you mean that there are men
also on the moon who enjoy their fruits; an idea which if not mythical
is impious. </p>
      <p><b>SAGR.</b> I do not know nor do I suppose that herbs or
plants or
animals similar to ours are propagated on the moon, or that rains and
winds
and thunderstorms occur there as on the earth; much less that it is
inhabited
by men. Yet I still do not see that it necessarily follows that since
things
similar to ours are not generated there, no alterations at all take
place,
or that there cannot be things there that do change or are generated
and
dissolve; things not only different from ours, but so far from our
conceptions
as to be entirely unimaginable by us. </p>
      <p>I am certain that a person born and raised in a huge forest
among wild
beasts and birds, and knowing nothing of the watery element, would
never
be able to frame in his imagination another world existing in nature
differing
from his, filled with animals which would travel without legs or
fast beating
wings, and not upon its surface alone like beasts upon the earth, but
everywhere
within its depths; and not only moving, but stopping motionless
wherever
they pleased, a thing which birds in the air cannot do. And that men
lived
there too, and built palaces and cities, and traveled with such ease
that
without tiring themselves at all they could proceed to far countries
with
their families and households and whole cities. Now as I say, I am sure
that such a man could not, even with the liveliest imagination, ever
picture
to himself fishes, the ocean, ships, fleets, and armadas. Thus, and
more
so, might it happen that in the moon, separated from us by so much
greater
an interval and made of materials perhaps much different from those on
earth, substances exist and actions occur which are not merely remote
from
but completely beyond all our imaginings, lacking any resemblance to
ours
and therefore being entirely unthinkable. For that which we imagine
must
be either something already seen or a composite of things and parts of
things seen at different times; such are sphinxes, sirens, chimeras,
centaurs,
etc. </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> Many times have I given rein to my fancies about
these
things, and my conclusion is that it is indeed possible to discover
some
things that do not and cannot exist on the moon, but none which I
believe
can be and are there, except very generally; that is, things occupying
it, acting and moving in it, perhaps in a very different way from ours,
seeing and admiring the grandeur and beauty of the universe and of its
Maker and Director and continually singing encomiums in His praise. I
mean,
in a word, doing what is so frequently decreed in the Holy Scriptures;
namely, a perpetual occupation of all creatures in praising God. </p>
      <p><b>SAGR.</b> These are among the things which, speaking very
generally,
could be there. But I should like to hear you mention those which you
believe
cannot be there, as it must be possible for you to name them more
specifically. </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> I warn you, Sagredo, that this will be the third
time we
have thus strayed imperceptibly, step by step, from our principal
topic,
and we shall get to the point of our argument but slowly if we make
digressions.
Therefore it will perhaps be good if we defer this matter, along with
others
we have agreed to put off until a special session. </p>
      <p><b>SAGR.</b> Please, now that we are on the moon, let us go on
with
things that pertain to it, so that we shall not have to make another
trip
over so long a road.... </p>
      <p>[<i>Salviati, using data from telescopic observations,
describes the
features of the moon and its resemblance to earth: it is spherical,
mountainous,
and has areas of contrasting brightness.&nbsp; Simplico argues that the
moon is a perfectly smooth sphere made of celestial matter.&nbsp; The
three
engage in an extended argument about the nature of the moon.]</i> </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> Therefore, in your opinion, the earth would make
an appearance
similar to that which we see in the moon, of at most two parts. But do
you believe then that those great spots which are seen on the face of
the
moon are seas, and the brighter balance land, or some such thing? </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> What you are now asking me is the first of the
differences
that I think exist between the moon and the earth, which we had better
hurry along with, as we are staying too long on the moon. I say then
that
if there were in nature only one way for two surfaces to be illuminated
by the sun so that one appears lighter than the other, and that this
were
by having one made of land and the other of water, it would be
necessary
to say that the moon's surface was partly terrene and partly aqueous.
But
because there are more ways known to us that could produce the same
effect,
and perhaps others that we do not know of, I shall not make bold to
affirm
one rather than another to exist on the moon. </p>
      <p>We have already seen that a bleached silver plate changes from
white
to dark by the touch of the burnisher; the watery part of the earth
looks
darker than the dry; on the ridges of mountains the wooded parts look
much
gloomier than the open and barren places because the plants cast a
great
deal of shadow while the clearings are lighted by the sun. Such a
mixture
of shadows is so effective that in sculptured velvet the color of the
cut
silk looks much darker than that of the uncut, because of shadows cast
between one thread and another; and plain velvet is likewise much
darker
than taffeta made of the same silk. So if on the moon there were things
resembling dense forests, their aspect would probably be like that of
the
spots we see; a like difference would be created if they were seas;
and,
finally, there is nothing to prevent these spots being really of a
darker
color than the rest, for it is in that way that snow makes mountains
appear
brighter. </p>
      <p>What is clearly seen in the moon is that the darker parts are
all plains,
with few rocks and ridges in them, though there are some. The brighter
remainder is all fill of rocks, mountains, round ridges, and other
shapes,
and in particular there are great ranges of mountains around the spots.
That the spots are flat surfaces we are certain, from observing that
the
boundary which separates the light and dark parts makes an even cut in
traversing the spots, whereas in the bright parts it looks broken and
jagged.
But I do not know whether this evenness of surface is enough by itself
to cause the apparent darkness, and I rather think not. </p>
      <p>Quite apart from this, I consider the moon very different from
the earth.
Though I fancy to myself that its regions are not idle and dead, still
I do not assert that life and motion exist there, and much less that
plants,
animals, or other things similar to ours are generated there. Even if
they
were, they would be extremely diverse, and far beyond all our
imaginings.
I am inclined to believe this because in the first place I think that
the
material of the lunar globe is not land and water, and this alone is
enough
to prevent generations and alterations similar to ours. But even
supposing
land and water on the moon, there are in any case two reasons that
plants
and animals similar to ours would not be produced there. </p>
      <p>The first is that the varying aspects of the sun are so
necessary for
our various species that these could not exist at all without them. Now
the behavior of the sun toward the earth is much different from that
which
it displays toward the moon. As to daily illumination, we on the earth
have for the most part twenty -- four hours divided between day and
night,
but the same effect takes a month on the moon. The annual sinking and
rising
by which the sun causes the various seasons and the inequalities of day
and night are finished for the moon in a month. And whereas for us the
sun rises and sinks so much that between its maximum and minimum
altitudes
there lie forty -- seven degrees of difference (that is, as much as the
distance between the tropics), for the moon it varies no more than ten
degrees or a little less, which is the amount of the maximum latitudes
of its orbit with respect to the ecliptic. </p>
      <p>Now think what the action of the sun would be in the torrid
zone if
for fifteen days without pause it continued to beat down with its rays.
It goes without saying that all the plants and herbs and animals would
be destroyed; hence if any species existed there, they would be plants
and animals very different from present ones. </p>
      <p>In the second place, I am sure that there are no rains on the
moon,
because if clouds collected in any part of it, as around the earth,
they
would hide some of the things on the moon that we see with the
telescope.
Briefly, the scene would alter in some respect; an effect which I have
never seen during long and diligent observations, having always
discovered
a very pure and uniform serenity. </p>
      <p><b>SAGR.</b> To this it might be replied that either there
might be
great dews or that it rains there during its nights; that is, when the
sun does not light it up. </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> If from other appearances we had any signs that
there were
species similar to ours there, and only the occurrence of rains was
lacking,
we should be able to find this or some other condition to take their
place,
as happens in Egypt by the inundations of the Nile. But finding no
event
whatever like ours, of the many that would be required to produce
similar
effects, there is no point in troubling to introduce one only, and even
that one not from sure observation but because of mere possibility.
Besides,
if I were asked what my basic knowledge and natural reason told me
regarding
the production there of things similar to or different from ours, I
should
always reply, "Very different and entirely unimaginable by us"; for
this
seems to me to fit with the richness of nature and the omnipotence of
the
Creator and Ruler. </p>
      <p><b>SAGR.</b> It always seems to me extreme rashness on the
part of some
when they want to make human abilities the measure of what nature can
do.
On the contrary, there is not a single effect in nature, even the least
that exists, such that the most ingenious theorists can arrive at a
complete
understanding of it. This vain presumption of understanding everything
can have no other basis than never understanding anything. For anyone
who
had experienced just once the perfect understanding of one single
thing,
and had truly tasted how knowledge is accomplished, would recognize
that
of the infinity of other truths he understands nothing. </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> Your argument is quite conclusive; in
confirmation of it
we have the evidence of those who do understand or have understood some
thing; the more such men have known, the more they have recognized and
freely confessed their little knowledge. And the wisest of the Greeks,
so adjudged by the oracle, said openly that he recognized that he knew
nothing. </p>
      <p><b>SIMP</b>. It must be said, then, that either the oracle or
Socrates
himself was a liar, the former declaring him the wisest, and the latter
saying he knew himself the most ignorant. </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> Neither of your alternatives follows, since both
pronouncements
can be true. The oracle judges Socrates wisest above all other men,
whose
wisdom is limited; Socrates recognizes his knowing nothing relative to
absolute wisdom which is infinite. And since much is the same part of
infinite
as little, or as nothing (for to arrive at an infinite number it makes
no difference whether we accumulate thousands, tens, or zeros),
Socrates
did well to recognize his limited knowledge to be as nothing to the
infinity
which he lacked. But since there is nevertheless some knowledge to be
found
among men, and this is not equally distributed to all, Socrates could
have
had a larger share than others and thus have verified the response of
the
oracle. </p>
      <p><b>SAGR.</b> I think I understand this point quite well. Among
men there
exists the power to act, Simplicio, but it is not equally shared by
all;
and no doubt the power of an emperor is greater than that of a private
person, but both are nil in comparison to Divine omnipotence. Among men
there are some who understand agriculture better than others; but what
has knowing how to plant a grapevine in a ditch got to do with knowing
how to make it take root, draw nourishment, take from this some part
good
for building leaves, some other for forming tendrils, this for the
bunches,
that for the grapes, the other for the skins, all this being the work
of
most wise Nature? This is one single particular example of the
innumerable
works of Nature, and in this alone may be recognized an infinite
wisdom;
hence one may conclude that Divine wisdom is infinitely infinite. </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> Here is another example. Do we not say that the
art of
discovering a beautiful statue in a block of marble has elevated the
genius
of Michelangelo far, far above the ordinary minds of other men? Yet
this
work is nothing but the copying of a single attitude and position of
the
external and superficial members of one motionless man. Then what is it
in comparison with a man made by Nature, composed of so many members,
external
and internal, of so many muscles, tendons, nerves, bones, that serve so
many and such diverse motions? And what shall we say of the senses, of
spiritual power, and finally of the understanding? May we not rightly
say
that the making of a statue yields by an infinite amount to the
formation
of a live man, even to the formation of the lowest worm? </p>
      <p><b>SAGR.</b> And what difference do you think there was
between the
dove of Archytas and a natural dove? </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> Either I am without understanding or there is a
manifest
contradiction in this argument of yours. Among your greatest encomiums,
if not indeed the greatest of all, is your praise for the understanding
which you attribute to natural man. A little while ago you agreed with
Socrates that his understanding was nil. Then you must say that not
even
Nature understood how to make an intellect that could understand. </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> You put the point very sharply, and to answer the
objection
it is best to have recourse to a philosophical distinction and to say
that
the human understanding can be taken in two modes, the <i>intensive</i>
or the <i>extensive. Extensively</i>, that is, with regard to the
multitude
of intelligibles, which are infinite, the human understanding is as
nothing
even if it understands a thousand propositions; for a thousand in
relation
to infinity is zero. But taking man's understanding <i>intensively</i>,
in so far as this term denotes understanding some proposition
perfectly,
I say that the human intellect does understand some of them perfectly,
and thus in these it has as much absolute certainty as Nature itself
has.
Of such are the mathematical sciences alone; that is, geometry and
arithmetic,
in which the Divine intellect indeed knows infinitely more
propositions,
since it knows all. But with regard to those few which the human
intellect
does understand, I believe that its knowledge equals the Divine in
objective
certainty, for here it succeeds in understanding necessity, beyond
which
there can be no greater sureness. </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> This speech strikes me as very bold and daring. </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> These are very ordinary propositions and far from
any shade
of temerity or boldness. They do not detract in the least from the
majesty
of Divine wisdom, just as saying that God cannot undo what is done does
not in the least diminish His omnipotence. But I question, Simplicio,
whether
your suspicion does not arise from your having taken my words
equivocally.
So in order to explain myself better, I say that as to the truth of the
knowledge which is given by mathematical proofs, this is the same that
Divine wisdom recognizes; but I shall concede to you indeed that the
way
in which God knows the infinite propositions of which we know some few
is exceedingly more excellent than ours. Our method proceeds with
reasoning
by steps from one conclusion to another, while His is one of simple
intuition.
We, for example, in order to win a knowledge of some properties of the
circle (which has an infinity of them), begin with one of the simplest,
and, taking this for the definition of circle, proceed by reasoning to
another property, and from this to a third, and then a fourth, and so
on;
but the Divine intellect, by a simple apprehension of the circle's
essence,
knows without time&#8249;consuming reasoning all the infinity of its
properties.
Next, all these properties are in effect virtually included in the
definitions
of all things; and ultimately, through being infinite, are perhaps but
one in their essence and in the Divine mind. Nor is all the above
entirely
unknown to the human mind either, but it is clouded with deep and thick
mists, which become partly dispersed and clarified when we master some
conclusions and get them so firmly established and so readily in our
possession
that we can run over them very rapidly. For, after all, what more is
there
to the square on the hypotenuse being equal to the squares on the other
two sides, than the equality of two parallelograms on equal bases and
between
parallel lines? And is this not ultimately the same as the equality of
two surfaces which when superimposed are not increased, but are
enclosed
within the same boundaries? Now these advances, which our intellect
makes
laboriously and step by step, run through the Divine mind like light in
an instant; which is the same as saying that everything is always
present
to it. </p>
      <p>I conclude from this that our understanding, as well in the
manner as
in the number of things understood, is infinitely surpassed by the
Divine;
but I do not thereby abase it so much as to consider it absolutely
null.
No, when I consider what marvelous things and how many of them men have
understood, inquired into, and contrived, I recognize and understand
only
too clearly that the human mind is a work of God's, and one of the most
excellent. </p>
      <p><b>SAGR.</b> I myself have many times considered in the same
vein what
you are now saying, and how great may be the acuteness of the human
mind.
And when I run over the many and marvelous inventions men have
discovered
in the arts as in letters, and then reflect upon my own knowledge, I
count
myself little better than miserable. I am so far from being able to
promise
myself, not indeed the finding out of anything new, but even the
learning
of what has already been discovered, that I feel stupid and confused,
and
am goaded by despair. If I look at some excellent statue, I say within
my heart: "When will you be able to remove the excess from a block of
marble
and reveal so lovely a figure hidden therein? When will you know how to
mix different colors and spread them over a canvas or a wall and
represent
all visible objects by their means, like a Michelangelo, a Raphael, or
a Titian?" Looking at what men have found out about arranging the
musical
intervals and forming precepts and rules in order to control them for
the
wonderful delight of the ear, when shall T be able to cease my
amazement?
What shall I say of so many and such diverse instruments? With what
admiration
the reading of excellent poets fills anyone who attentively studies the
invention and interpretation of concepts And what shall I say of
architecture?
What of the art of navigation? </p>
      <p>But surpassing all stupendous inventions, what sublimity of
mind was
his who dreamed of finding means to communicate his deepest thoughts to
any other person, though distant by mighty intervals of place and time!
Of talking with those who are in India; of speaking to those who are
not
yet born and will not he born for a thousand or ten thousand years; and
with what facility, by the different arrangements of twenty characters
upon a page! </p>
      <p>Let this be the seal of all the admirable inventions of
mankind and
the close of our discussions for this day. The honest hours now being
past,
I think that Salviati might like to enjoy our cool ones in a gondola;
and
tomorrow I shall expect you both so that we may continue the
discussions
now begun. </p>
