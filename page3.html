      <p><b>SAGREDO.</b> I have been impatiently awaiting your arrival,
that
I might hear the novel views about the annual rotation of this globe of
ours. This has made the hours seem very long to me last night and this
morning, though I have not passed them idly. On the contrary, I have
lain
awake most of the night running over in my mind yesterday's arguments
and
considering the reasons adopted by each side in favor of these two
opposing
positions--the earlier one of Aristotle and Ptolemy, and this later one
of Anistarchus and Copernicus. And truly it seems to me that whichever
of these theories happens to be wrong, the arguments in its favor are
so
plausible that it deserves to he pardoned--so long as we pause at the
ones
produced by its original weighty authors. Yet because of its antiquity
the Peripatetic opinion has had many followers, while the other has had
but few, partly because of its difficulty and partly because of its
novelty.
And among the partisans of the former, especially in modem times, I
seem
to discern some who introduce very childish, not to say ridiculous,
reasons
in maintaining the opinion which appears to them to be true.
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> The same thing has struck me even more forcibly
than you.
I have heard such things put forth as I should blush to repeat--not so
much to avoid discrediting their authors (whose names could always be
withheld)
as to refrain from detracting so greatly from the honor of the human
race.
In the long run my observations have convinced me that some men,
reasoning
preposterously, first establish some conclusion In their minds which,
either
because of its being their own or because of their having received it
from
some person who has their entire confidence, impresses them so deeply
that
one finds it impossible ever to get it out of their heads. Such
arguments
in support of their fixed idea as they hit upon themselves or hear set
forth by others, no matter how simple and stupid these may be, gain
their
instant acceptance and applause. On the other hand whatever is brought
forward against it, however ingenious and conclusive, they receive with
disdain or with hot rage--if indeed it does not make them ill. Beside
themselves
with passion, some of them would not be backward even about scheming to
suppress and silence their adversaries. I have had some experience of
this
myself.
      </p>
      <p><b>SAGR.</b> I know; such men do not deduce their conclusion
from its
premises or establish it by reason, but they accommodate (I should have
said discommode and distort) the premises and reasons to a conclusion
which
for them is already established and nailed down. No good can come of
dealing
with such people, especially to the extent that their company may be
not
only unpleasant but dangerous. Therefore let us continue with our good
Simplicio, who has long been known to me as a man of great ingenuity
and
entirely without malice. Besides, he is intimately familiar with the
Peripatetic
doctrine, and I am sure that whatever he does not think up in support
of
Aristotle's opinion is not I likely to occur to anybody.
      </p>
      <p>But here, all out of breath, comes the very person who has
been wished
for so long today. --We were just now maligning you.
      </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> Please don't scold me; blame Neptune for my long
delay.
For in this morning's ebb he withdrew the waters in such a manner that
the gondola in which I was riding, having entered an unlined canal not
far from here, was left high and dry. I had to stay there over an hour
awaiting the return of the tide. And while I was there, unable to get
out
of the boat (which had run aground almost instantly), I fell to
observing
an event which struck me as quite remarkable. As the water slackened,
it
might he seen to run very swiftly through various rivulets, the mud
being
exposed in many places. While I was watching this effect, I saw this
motion
along one stretch come to a halt, and without pausing a moment the same
water would begin to return, the sea turning from retreat to advance
without
remaining stationary for an instant. This is an effect which I have
never
happened to see before in all the time I have frequented Venice.
      </p>
      <p><b>SAGR.</b> Then you cannot often have happened to be
stranded among
little trickles. On account of their having scarcely any slope, the
sinking
or rising of the open sea by merely the thickness of a sheet of paper
is
enough to make the water flow and return a long distance through such
rivulets.
On some seacoasts the rising of the sea only a few yards makes the
water
spill over the plains for many thousands of acres.
      </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> I know that well enough, but I should think that
between
the lowest point of the sinking and the first point of the rising, some
perceptible interval of rest would be bound to intervene.
      </p>
      <p><b>SAGR.</b> It will appear so to you when you have in mind
walls or
pilings, upon which this change takes place vertically. But actually
there
is no state of rest.
      </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> It would seem to me that these being two contrary
motions,
there would have to be some rest midway between them, in agreement with
Aristotle's doctrine proving that <i>in puncto regressus mediat quies.</i><font
 size="-1">(note:
At the instant of retreat, an interval of calm.)</font>
      </p>
      <p><b>SAGR.</b> I remember the passage well, and I also recall
that when
I was studying philosophy I was not convinced by Aristotle's proof
Indeed,
I have had many experiences to the contrary. I might mention them now,
but I do not want to have us wander into any more abysses. We have met
here to discuss our subject, if possible, without interrupting it as we
have in the past two days.
      </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> Still it will be good, if not to interrupt it, at
least
to extend it somewhat. For upon returning home yesterday evening I fell
to rereading that booklet of theses, where I found some very convincing
proofs against this annual motion which is attributed to the earth. And
since I did not trust myself to quote them exactly, I have brought the
booklet along with me. <font size="-1">(note: This is the pamphlet <i>De
tribus novis stellis quae annis 1572, 1600, 1609 comparuere (1628)</i>
by Scipio Chiaramonti, which Simplicio refenred to on the first day (<i>cf</i>
p. 14).)</font>
      </p>
      <p><b>SAGR.</b> You have done well. But if we mean to take up our
discussion
again in accordance with yesterday's agreement, we must first hear what
Salviati has to say about the book on the new stars. Then, without
further
interruptions, we may examine the annual motion.
      </p>
      <p>Now, Salviati, what have you to say in regard to these stars?
Have they
really been drawn down from the heavens into these baser regions by
virtue
of the calculations made by this author whom Simplicio has produced?
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> Last night I undertook to study his procedures,
and this
morning I gave them another glance, wondering whether what I thought I
had been reading the night before was really written there, or whether
I was the victim of ghosts and fantastic imaginings of the night. To my
great regret, I found actually written and printed there that which,
for
the sake of this philosopher's reputation, I should have wished had not
been. It seems impossible to me that he does not realize the vanity of
his enterprise, both because it Is so obvious and because I remember
having
heard our friend the Academician praise him. It also seems to me very
hard
to believe that out of deference to others he could be persuaded to
hold
his own reputation in such low esteem as to be induced to publish a
work
from which nothing but censure could be expected from the learned.
      </p>
      <p><b>SAGR.</b> You might add that there will be rather less than
one in
a hundred of these, to offset those who will celebrate and exalt him
over
all the most learned men who exist now or ever have. A man able to
sustain
the Peripatetic inalterability of the heavens against a host of
astronomers,
and one who, to their greater shame, has done battle against them with
their own weapons! And if there are half a dozen to a province who
perceive
his trivialities, what are they against the innumerable multitude who
(being
able neither to discover these nor to comprehend them) are taken in by
all the shouting, and applaud the more the less they understand? And
even
the few who do understand scorn to make a reply to such worthless and
inconclusive
scribbles. With good reason, too; for those who do understand have no
need
of this, and upon those who do not understand it is wasted effort.
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> Silence would indeed be the most appropriate
reprimand
for their worthlessness, were there not other reasons which practically
force one to repudiate them. One reason is that we Italians are making
ourselves look like ignoramuses and are a laughingstock for foreigners,
especially for those who have broken with our religion; I could show
you
some very famous ones who joke about our Academician and the many
mathematicians
in Italy for letting the follies of a certain Lorenzini <font size="-1">(note:
A criticism leveled by Kepler.) </font>appear in print and be
maintained
as his views without contradiction. But this also might be overlooked
In
comparison with another and greater occasion for laughter that might be
mentioned, which is the hypocrisy of the learned toward the trifling of
opponents of this stripe in matters which they do not understand.
      </p>
      <p><b>SAGR.</b> I could not ask for a better example of their
petulance,
or of the unhappy situation of a man like Copernicus, placed under the
carping of those who do not understand even the rudiments of the
position
against which they have declared war.
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> You will be no less astonished at their manner of
refuting
the astronomers who declare the new stars to be above the orbits of the
planets, and perhaps among the fixed stars themselves <i>(nel
firmamento)</i>.
      </p>
      <p><b>SAGR.</b> But how can you have examined this whole book in
such a
short time? It is certainly a large volume, and there must be numerous
demonstrations in it.
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> I stopped after these first refutations of his in
which,
with twelve demonstrations founded upon the observations of twelve of
the
astronomers who thought that the new star of 1572 (which appeared in
Cassiopeia)
was in the firmament, he proves it on the contrary to have been
sublunar.
To do this he compares, two by two, the meridian altitudes taken by
different
observers in places of different latitude, proceeding in a manner which
you will understand presently. And it seems to me that in examining
this
first procedure of his I have detected in this author a great inability
to prove anything against the astronomers or in favor of the
Peripatetic
philosophers, and that indeed he only confirms their opinion more
conclusively.
Therefore I did not want to devote myself with equal patience to the
examination
of his other methods; having given them a superficial glance, I am
positive
that the inconclusiveness which pervades his first refutation would
exist
in the others likewise. And the fact is (as you will soon see) that a
very
few words suffice to refute this work, although it is built up with so
many laborious calculations, as you have perceived.
      </p>
      <p>Therefore you shall hear how I proceeded. The author, I say,
in order
to attack his adversaries with their own weapons, takes a large number
of the observations which they themselves have made, these authors
being
twelve or thirteen in number. On a part of these he bases his
calculations,
and he deduces such stars to have been below the moon. Now since I am
very
fond of proceeding by interrogation, and since the author is not here
himself,
you, Simplicio, shall reply to the queries I am going to make, and say
whatever you believe he would say.
      </p>
      <p>Assuming that we are dealing with the nova of 1572 appearing
in Cassiopeia,
tell me, Simplicio, whether you think it might have been in different
places
at the same time. That is, could it he amidst the elements and also be
among the planetary orbits, and in addition be above these among the
fixed
stars, as well as being infinitely higher?
      </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> Doubtless one must say that it was located in a
single
place, at a unique and determinate distance from the earth.
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> Then if the observations made by the astronomers
were correct,
and if the calculations made by this author were not erroneous, both
the
former and the latter would necessarily have to yield exactly the same
distance; isn't that right?
      </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> So far as I can see it would necessarily be so,
nor do
I believe that the author would contradict this.
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> But if, of many computations, not even two came
out in
agreement, what would you think of that?
      </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> I should judge that all were fallacious, either
through
some fault of the computer or some defect on the part of the observers.
At best I might say that a single one, and no more, might be correct;
but
I should not know which one to choose.
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> But would you want to deduce a questionable
conclusion
and establish it as true, from a false basis? Surely not. Now this
author's
calculations are such that not one of them agrees with any other; you
see,
then, bow much faith you can put in them.
      </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> If that is how matters stand, it is truly a
serious defect.
      </p>
      <p><b>SAGR.</b> I want to help Simplicio and his author out by
saying to
you, Salviati, that your case would indeed be conclusive if the author
had undertaken to find out definitely how far the star was from the
earth.
But I do not believe that that was his intent; he wished only to show
that
the star was sublunar. Now if, from the observations mentioned and from
all the calculations made on these, the height of the star can always
be
inferred to have been less than that of the moon, this would suffice
the
author to convict of the crassest ignorance all those astronomers who,
whether they erred in geometry or in arithmetic, could not deduce the
true
conclusions from their own observations.
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> Then I had better turn MY attention to you,
Sagredo, since
you so cunningly sustain the author's doctrine. And let us see whether
I can also persuade Simplicio (although he is unskilled at calculations
and proofs) that this author's demonstrations are inconclusive to say
the
least. Consider first that both he and all the astronomers he is in
conflict
with agree that the new star had no motion of its own, but merely went
around with the diurnal motion of the <i>primum mobile</i>. But they
disagree
about its place, the astronomers putting it in the celestial regions
(that
is, above the moon) and perhaps among the fixed stars, while he judges
it to be near the earth; that is, under the arc of the moon's orbit.
And
since the site of the new star of which we are speaking was toward the
north and at no great distance from the pole, so that for us
northerners
it never set, it was a simple matter to take its meridian altitudes by
means of astronomical instruments--its minimal below the pole as well
as
its maximal above the pole. By combining these, when the observations
were
made at different places on the earth and at different distances from
the
north (that is, at places differing among themselves as to polar
elevation),
the distance of the star could be reasoned out. For if it was placed in
the firmament among the other fixed stars, its meridian altitudes when
taken at different elevations of the pole would have to differ among
themselves
in the same way as did these polar elevations. Thus, for example, if
the
altitude of the star above the horizon had been thirty degrees when
taken
at a place where the polar elevation was, say, forty-five degrees, then
the altitude of the star ought to be increased four or five degrees in
those more northerly lands in which the pole is four or five degrees
higher.
But if the distance of the star from the earth was very small in
comparison
with that of the firmament, then its meridian altitudes should have
increased
noticeably more than the polar elevations as the pole was approached.
From
such a greater increase--that is, from the excess of the increase of
the
star's elevation over the increase of the polar altitude, which is
called
a difference of parallax--the distance of the star from the center of
the
earth may be quickly calculated by a clear and certain method.
      </p>
      <p>Now this author takes the observations made by thirteen
astronomers
at different polar elevations, and comparing a part of these (which he
selects) he calculates, by using twelve pairings, that the height of
the
new star was always below the moon. But he achieves this by expecting
such
gross ignorance on the part of everyone into whose hands his book might
fall that it quite turns my stomach. I can hardly see how the other
astronomers
contain themselves in silence. Especially Kepler, against whom this
author
particularly declaims; he would not be one to hold his tongue, unless
he
considered the matter beneath his notice.
      </p>
      <p>Now for your information I have copied on these pages the
conclusions
that he deduces from his twelve investigations....
      </p>
      <p><b>SAGR.</b> This is as if I were watching some unfortunate
farmer who,
after having all his expected harvest beaten down and destroyed by a
tempest,
goes about with pallid and downcast face, gathering up such poor
gleanings
as would not serve to feed a chicken for one day.
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> Truly, it was with too scant a store of
ammunition that
this author rose up against the assailers of the sky's inalterability,
and it is with chains too fragile that he has attempted to pull the new
star down from Cassiopeia in the highest heavens to these base and
elemental
regions. Now, since the great difference between the arguments of the
astronomers
and of this opponent of theirs seems to me to have been very clearly
demonstrated,
we may as well leave this point and return to our main subject. We
shall
next consider the annual movement generally attributed to the sun, but
then, first by Aristarchus of Samos and later by Copernicus, removed
from
the sun and transferred to the earth. Against this position I know that
Simplicio comes strongly armed, in particular with the sword and
buckler
of his booklet of theses or mathematical disquisitions. It will be good
to commence by producing the objections from this booklet.
      </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> If you don't mind, I am going to leave those for
the last,
since they were the most recently discovered.
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> Then you had better take up in order, in
accordance with
our previous procedure, the contrary arguments by Aristotle and the
other
ancients. I also shall do so, in order that nothing shall be left out
or
escape careful consideration and examination. Likewise Sagredo, with
his
quick wit, shall interpose his thoughts as the spirit moves him.
      </p>
      <p><b>SAGR. </b>I shall do so with my customary lack of tact;
and since
you have asked for this, you will be obliged to pardon it.
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> This favor will oblige me to thank and not to
pardon you.
But now let Simplicio begin to set forth those objections which
restrain
him from believing that the earth, like the other planets, may revolve
about a fixed center.
      </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> The first and greatest difficulty is the
repugnance and
incompatibility between being at the center and being distant from it.
For if the terrestrial globe must move in a year around the
circumference
of a circle--that is, around the zodiac--it is impossible for it at the
same time to be in the center of the zodiac. But the earth is at that
center,
as is proved in many ways by Aristotle, Ptolemy, and others.
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> Very well argued. There can be no doubt that
anyone who
wants to have the earth move along the circumference of a circle must
first
prove that it is not at the center of that circle. The next thing is
for
us to see whether the earth is or is not at that center around which I
say it turns, and in which you say it is situated. And prior to this,
it
is necessary that we declare ourselves as to whether or not you and I
have
the same concept of this center. Therefore tell me what and where this
center is that you mean.
      </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> I mean by "center," that of the universe; that of
the world;
that of the stellar sphere; that of the heavens.
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> I might very reasonably dispute whether there is
in nature
such a center, seeing that neither you nor anyone else has so far
proved
whether the universe is finite and has a shape, or whether it is
infinite
and unbounded. Still, conceding to you for the moment that it is finite
and of bounded spherical shape, and therefore has its center, it
remains
to be seen how credible it is that the earth rather than some other
body
is to be found at that center.
      </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> Arislotle gives a hundred proofs that the
universe is finite,
bounded, and spherical.
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> Which are later all reduced to one, and that one
to none
at all. For if I deny him his assumption that the universe is movable
all
his' proofs fall to the ground, since he proves it to be finite and
bounded
only if the universe is movable. But in order not to multiply our
disputes,
I shall concede to you for the time being that the universe is finite,
spherical, and has a center. And since such a shape and center are
deduced
from mobility, it will be the more reasonable for us to proceed from
this
same circular motion of world bodies to a detailed investigation of the
proper position of the center. Even Aristotle himself reasoned about
and
decided this in the same way, making that point the center of the
universe
about which all the celestial spheres revolve, and at which he believed
the terrestrial globe to be situated. Now tell me, Simplicio: if
Aristotle
had found himself forced by the most palpable experiences to rearrange
in part this order and disposition of the universe, and to confess
himself
to have been mistaken about one of these two propositions--that is,
mistaken
either about putting the earth in the center, or about saying that the
celestial spheres move around such a center--which of these admissions
do you think that he would choose?
      </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> I think that if that should happen, the
Peripatetics ...
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> I am not asking the Peripatetics, I am asking
Aristotle
himself As for the former, I know very well what they would reply.
They,
as most reverent and most humble slaves of Aristotle, would deny all
the
experiences and observations in the world, and would even refuse to
look
at them in order not to have to admit them, and they would say that the
universe remains just as Aristotle has written; not as nature would
have
it. For take away the prop of his authority, and with what would you
have
them appear in the field? So now tell me what you think Aristotle
himself
would do.
      </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> Really, I cannot make up my mind which of these
two difficulties
he would have regarded as the lesser.
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> Please, do not apply this term "difficulty" to
something
that may necessarily be so, wishing to put the earth in the center of
the
celestial revolutions was a "difficulty." But since you do not know to
which side he would have leaned, and considering him as I do a man of
brilliant
intellect, let us set about examining which of the two choices is the
more
reasonable, and let us take that as the one which Aristotle would have
embraced. So, resuming our, reasoning once more from the beginning, let
us assume out of respect for Aristotle that the universe (of the
magnitude
of which we have no sensible information beyond the fixed stars), like
anything that is spherical in shape and moves circularly, has
necessarily
a center for its shape and for its motion. Being certain, moreover,
that
within the stellar sphere there are many orbs one inside another, with
their stars which also move circularly, our question is this: Which is
it more reasonable to believe and to say; that these included orbs move
around the same center as the universe does, or around some other one
which
is removed from that? Now you, Simplicio, say what you think about this
matter.
      </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> If we could stop with this one assumption and
were sure
of not running into something else that would disturb us, I should
think
it would be much more reasonable to say that the container and the
things
it contained all moved around one common center rather than different
ones.
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> Now if it is true that the center of the universe
is that
point around which all the orbs and world bodies (that is, the planets)
move, it is quite certain that not the earth, but the sun, is to be
found
at the center of the universe. Hence, as for this first general
conception,
the central place is the sun's, and the earth is to be found as far
away
from the center as it is from the sun.
      </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> How do you deduce that it is not the earth, but
the sun,
which is at the center of the revolutions of the planets?
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> This is deduced from most obvious and therefore
most powerfully
convincing observations. The most palpable of these, which excludes the
earth from the center and places the sun here, is that we find all the
planets closer to the earth at one time and farther from it at another.
The differences are so great that Venus, for example, is six times as
distant
from us at its farthest as at its closest, and Mars soars nearly eight
times as high in the one state as in the other. You may thus see
whether
Aristotle was not some trifle deceived in believing that they were
always
equally distant from us.
      </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> But what are the signs that they move around the
sun?
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> This is reasoned out from finding the three outer
planets--Mars,
Jupiter, and Saturn--always quite close to the earth when they are in
opposition
to the sun, and very distant when they are in conjunction with it. This
approach and recession is of such moment that Mars when close looks
sixty
times as large as when it is most distant. Next, it is certain that
Venus
and Mercury must revolve around the sun, because of their never moving
far away from it, and because of their being seen now beyond it and now
on this side of it, as Venus's changes of shape conclusively prove. <font
 size="-1">(note:
Venus has phases like the moon.)</font> As to the moon, it is true that
this can never separate from the earth in any way, for reasons that
will
be set forth more specifically as we proceed.
      </p>
      <p><b>SAGR.</b> I have hopes of hearing still more remarkable
things arising
from this annual motion of the earth than were those which depended
upon
its diurnal rotation.
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> You will not be disappointed, for as to the
action of the
diurnal motion upon celestial bodies, it was not and could not be
anything
different from what would appear if the universe were to rush speedily
in the opposite direction. But this annual motion, mixing with the
individual
motions of all the planets, produces a great many oddities which in the
past have baffled all the greatest men in the world.
      </p>
      <p>Now returning to these first general conceptions, I repeat
that the
center of the celestial rotation for the five planets, Saturn, Jupiter,
Mars, Venus, and Mercury, is the sun; this will hold for the earth too,
if we are successful in placing that in the heavens. Then as to the
moon,
it has a circular motion around the earth, from which as I have already
said it cannot be separated; but this does not keep it from going
around
the sun along with the earth in its annual movement.
      </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> I am not yet convinced of this arrangement at
all. Perhaps
I should understand it better from the drawing of a diagram, which
might
make it easier to discuss.
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> That shall be done. But for your greater
satisfaction and
your astonishment, too, I want you to draw it yourself You will see
that
however firmly you may believe yourself not to understand it, you do so
perfectly, and just by answering my questions you will describe it
exactly.
So take a sheet of paper and the compasses; let this page be the
enormous
expanse of the universe, in which you have to distribute and arrange
its
parts as reason shall direct you. And first, since you are sure without
my telling you that the earth is located in this universe, mark some
point
at your pleasure where you intend this to be located, and designate it
by means of some letter.
      </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> Let this be the place of the terrestrial globe,
marked
A.
      </p>
      <center>
      <p><img src="7.3.fig4.gif" alt="" hspace="10" vspace="10"
 border="0" width="218" height="243"></p>
      </center>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> Very well. I know in the second place that you
are aware
that this earth is not inside the body of the sun, nor even contiguous
to it, but is distant from it by a certain space. Therefore assign to
the
sun some other place of your choosing, as far from the earth as you
like,
and designate that also.
      </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> Here I have done it; let this be the sun's
position, marked
0.
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> These two established, I want you to think about
placing
Venus in such a way that its position and movement can conform to what
sensible experience shows us about it. Hence you must call to mind,
either
from past discussions or from your own observations, what you know
happens
with this star. Then assign it whatever place seems suitable for it to
you.
      </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> I shall assume that those appearances are correct
which
you have related and which I have read also in the booklet of theses;
that
is, that this star never recedes from the sun beyond a certain definite
interval of forty degrees or so; hence it not only never reaches
opposition
to the sun, but not even quadrature, nor so much as a sextile aspect. <font
 size="-1">(note:
i.e. 180&deg; 90&deg; and 60&deg;.)</font> Moreover, I shall assume
that
it displays itself to us about forty times as large at one time than at
another, greater when, being retrograde, It is approaching evening
conjunction
with the sun, and very small when it is moving forward toward morning
conjunction,
and furthermore that when it appears very large, it reveals itself in a
homed shape, and when it looks very small it appears perfectly round.
      </p>
      <p>These appearances being correct, I say, I do not see how to
escape affirming
that this star revolves in a circle around the sun, in such a way that
this circle cannot possibly be said to embrace and contain within
itself
the earth, nor to be beneath the sun (that is, between the sun and the
earth), nor yet beyond the sun. Such a circle cannot embrace the earth
because then Venus would sometimes be in opposition to the sun; it
cannot
be beneath the sun, for then Venus would appear sickle-shaped at both
conjunctions;
and it cannot be beyond the sun, since then it would always look round
and never homed. Therefore for its lodging I shall draw the circle CH
around
the sun, without having this include the earth.
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> Venus provided for, it is fitting to consider
Mercury,
which, as you know, keeping itself always around the sun, recedes
therefrom
much less than Venus. Therefore consider what place you should assign
to
it.
      </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> There is no doubt that, imitating Venus as it
does, the
most appropriate place for it will be a smaller circle, within this one
of Venus and also described about the sun. A reason for this, and
especially
for its proximity to the sun, is the vividness of Mercury's splendor
surpassing
that of Venus and all the other planets. Hence on this basis we may
draw
its circle here and mark it with the letters BG.
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> Next, where shall we put Mars?
      </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> Mars, since it does come into opposition with the
sun,
must embrace the earth with its circle. And I see that it must also
embrace
the sun; for, coming into conjunction with the sun, if it did not pass
beyond it but fell short of it, it would appear homed as Venus and the
moon do. But it always looks round; therefore its circle must include
the
sun as well as the earth. And since I remember your having said that
when
it is in opposition to the sun it looks sixty times as large as when in
conjunction, it seems to me that this phenomenon will be well provided
for by a circle around the sun embracing the earth, which I draw here
and
mark DI. When Mars is at the point D, it is very near the earth and in
opposition to the sun, but when it is at the point 1, it is in
conjunction
with the sun and very distant from the earth.
      </p>
      <p>And since the same appearances are observed with regard to
Jupiter and
Saturn (although with less variation in Jupiter than in Mars, and With
still less in Saturn than in Jupiter), it seems clear to me that we can
also accommodate these two planets very neatly with two circles, still
around the sun. This first one, for Jupiter, I mark EL; the other,
higher,
for Saturn, is called FM.
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> So far you have comported yourself uncommonly
well. And
since, as you see, the approach and recession of the three outer
planets
is measured by double the distance between the earth and the sun, this
makes a greater variation in Mars than in Jupiter because the circle DI
of Mars is smaller than the circle EL of Jupiter. Similarly, EL here is
smaller than the circle FM of Saturn, so the variation is still less in
Saturn than in Jupiter, and this corresponds exactly to the
appearances.
It now remains for you to think about a place for the moon.
      </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> Following the same method (which seems to me very
convincing),
since we see the moon come into conjunction and opposition with the
sun,
it must be admitted that its circle embraces the earth. But it must not
embrace the sun also, or else when it was in conjunction it would not
look
homed but always round and full of light. Besides, it would never cause
an eclipse of the sun for us, as it frequently does, by getting in
between
us and the sun. Thus one must assign to it a circle around the earth,
which
shall be this one, NP, in such a way that when at P it appears to us
here
on the earth A as in conjunction with the sun, which sometimes it will
eclipse in this position. Placed at N, it is seen in opposition to the
sun, and in that position it may fall under the earth's shadow and be
eclipsed.
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> Now what shall we do, Simplicio, with the fixed
stars?
Do we want to sprinkle them through the immense abyss of the universe,
at various distances from any predetermined point, or place them on a
spherical
surface extending around a center of their own so that each of them
will
be the same distance from that center?
      </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> I had rather take a middle course, and assign to
them an
orb described around a definite center and included between two
spherical
surfaces--a very distant concave one, and another closer and convex,
between
which are placed at vanious altitudes the innumerable host of stars.
This
might be called the universal sphere, containing within it the spheres
of the planets which we have already designated.
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> Well, Simplicio, what we have been doing all this
while
is arranging the world bodies according to the Copernican distribution,
and this has now been done by your own hand. Moreover you have assigned
their proper movements to them all except the sun, the earth, and the
stellar
sphere. To Mercury and Venus you have attributed a circular motion
around
the sun without embracing the earth. Around the same sun you have
caused
the three outer planets, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, to move, embracing
the earth within their circles. Next, the moon cannot move in any way
except
around the earth and without embracing the sun. And in all these
movements
you likewise agree with Copernicus himself It now remains to apportion
three things among the sun, the earth, and the stellar sphere: the
state
of rest which appears to belong to the earth; the annual motion through
the zodiac, which appears to belong to the sun; and the diurnal
movement,
which appears to belong to the stellar sphere, with all the rest of the
universe sharing in it except the earth. And since it is true that all
the planetary orbs (I mean Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn)
move
around the sun as a center, it seems most reasonable for the state of
rest
to belong to the sun rather than to the earth--just as it does for the
center of any movable sphere to remain fixed, rather than some other
point
of it remote from the center.
      </p>
      <p>Next as to the earth, which is placed in the midst of moving
object--I
mean between Venus and Mars, one of which makes its revolution in nine
months and the other in two years--a motion requiring one year may be
attributed
to it much more elegantly than a state of rest, leaving the latter for
the sun. And such being the case, it necessarily follows that the
diurnal
motion, too, belongs to the earth. For if the sun stood still, and the
earth did not revolve upon itself but merely had the annual movement
around
the sun, our year would consist of no more than one day and one night;
that is, six months of day and six months of night, as was remarked
once
previously.
      </p>
      <p>See, then, how neatly the precipitous motion of each
twenty-four hours
is taken away from the universe, and how the fixed stars (which are so
many suns) agree with OUT sun in enjoying perpetual rest. See also what
great simplicity is to be found in this rough sketch, yielding the
reasons
for so many weighty phenomena in the heavenly bodies.
      </p>
      <p><b>SAGR.</b> I see this very well indeed. But just as you
deduce from
this simplicity a large probability of truth in this system, others may
on the contrary make the opposite deduction from it. If this very
ancient
arrangement of the Pythagoreans is so well accommodated to the
appearances,
they may ask (and not unreasonably) why it has found so few followers
in
the course of centuries; why it has been refuted by Aristotle himself,
and why even Copernicus is not having any better luck with it in these
latter days.
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> Sagredo, if you had suffered even a few times, as
I have
so often, from hearing the sort of follies that are designed to make
the
common people contumacious and unwilling to listen to this innovation
(let
alone assent to it), then I think your astonishment at finding so few
men
holding this opinion would dwindle a good deal. It seems to me that we
can have little regard for imbeciles who take it as a conclusive proof
in confirmation of the earth's motionlessness, holding them firmly in
this
belief, when they observe that they cannot dine today at Constantinople
and sup in Japan, or for those who are positive that the earth is too
heavy
to climb up over the sun and then fall headlong back down again. There
is no need to bother about such men as these, whose name is legion, or
to take notice of their fooleries. Neither need we try to convert men
who
define by generalizing and cannot make room for distinctions, just in
order
to have such fellows for our company in very subtle and delicate
doctrines.
Besides, with all the proofs in the world what would you expect to
accomplish
in the minds of people who are too stupid to recognize their own
limitations?
      </p>
      <p>No, Sagredo, my surprise is very different from yours. You
wonder that
there are so few followers of the Pythagorean opinion, whereas I am
astonished
that there have been any up to this day who have embraced and followed
it. Nor can I ever sufficiently admire the outstanding acumen of those
who have taken hold of this opinion and accepted it as true; they have
through sheer force of intellect done such violence to their own senses
as to prefer what reason told them over that which sensible experience
plainly showed them to the contrarv. For the arguments against the
whirling
of the earth which we have already examined are very plausible, as we
have
seen; and the fact that the Ptolemiacs and Aristotelians and all their
disciples took them to be conclusive is indeed a strong argument of
their
effectiveness. But the experiences which overtly contradict the annual
movement are Indeed so much greater in their apparent force that, I
repeat,
there is no limit to my astonishment when I reflect that Aristarchus
and
Copernicus were able to make reason so conquer sense that, in defiance
of the latter, the former became mistress of their belief
      </p>
      <p><b>SAGR.</b> Then we are about to encounter still further
strong attacks
against this annual movement?
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> We are, and such obvious and sensible ones that
were it
not for the existence of a superior and better sense than natural and
common
sense to join forces with reason, I much question whether 1, too,
should
not have been much more recalcitrant toward the Copemican system than I
have been since a clearer light than usual has illuminated me.
      </p>
      <p><b>SAGR.</b> Well, then, Salviati, let us get down to cases,
as they
say; for every word spent otherwise seems to me to be wasted.
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> I am at your service ...
      </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> Gentlemen, please give me a chance to restore
harmony to
my mind, which I now find very much upset by certain matters which
Salviati
has just touched upon. Then, when this storm has subsided, I shall be
able
to listen to your theories more profitably. For there is no use forming
an image in a wavy mirror, as the Latin poet has told us so graciously
by writing:
      </p>
      <center>
      <p><i>... nuper me in lillore vidi,</i>
      <br>
      <i>Cum placidum ventis staret mare.</i></p>
      </center>
      <p><font size="-1">["Upon the shore I lately viewed myself, When
the sea
stood still, unruffled by the winds." (Virgil, Bucolics 2.25)]</font>
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> You are quite right; tell us your difficulties.
      </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> Those who deny the diurnal motion to the earth
because
they do not see themselves being transported to Persia or Japan have
been
called by you just as dull-witted as those who oppose the annual motion
because of the repugnance they feel against admitting that the vast and
ponderous bulk of the terrestrial globe can raise itself on high and
then
descend to the depths, as it would have to do if it revolved about the
sun annually. Now I, without blushing to be numbered among such
simpletons,
feel in my own mind this very repugnance as to the second point against
the annual motion, the more so when I see how much resistance is made
to
motion even over a plain by, I shall not say a mountain, but a mere
stone;
and even the former would be but the tiniest fraction of an Alpine
range.
Therefore I beg you not to scorn such objections entirely, but to solve
them; and not for me alone, but also for others to whom they seem quite
real. For I think it is very difficult for some people, simple though
they
may be, to recognize and admit that they are simple just because they
know
themselves to be so regarded.
      </p>
      <p><b>SAGR.</b> Indeed, the simpler they are, the more nearly
impossible
it will be to convince them of their own shortcomings. And on this
account
I think that it is good to resolve this and all similar objections, not
only that Simplicio should be satisfied, but also for other reasons no
less important. For it is clear that there are plenty of people who are
well versed in philosophy and. the other sciences but who, either
through
lack of astronomy or mathematics or some other discipline which would
sharpen
their minds for the penetration of truth, adhere to silly doctrines
like
these. That is why the situation of poor Copernicus seems to me
lamentable;
he could expect only censure for his views and could not let them fall
into the hands of anyone who, being unable to comprehend his arguments
(which are very subtle and therefore difficult to master), would be
convinced
of their falsity on account of some superficial appearances, and would
go about declaring them to be wrong and full of error. If people cannot
be convinced by the arguments, which are quite abstruse, it is good to
make sure that they recognize the vapidity of these objections. From
such
knowledge comes moderation in their judgement and condemnation of the
doctrine
which at present they consider erroneous. Accordingly I shall raise two
other objections against the diurnal motion, which not so long ago were
to be heard put forward by important men of letters, and after that we
shall look into the annual motion.
      </p>
      <p>The first was that if it were true that the sun and other
stars did
not rise over the eastern horizon, but the eastern side of the earth
sank
beneath them while they remained motionless, then it would follow that
after a short time the mountains, sinking downward with the rotation of
the terrestrial globe, would get into such a position that whereas a
little
earlier one would have had to climb steeply to their peaks, a few hours
later one would have to stoop and descend in order to get there.
      </p>
      <p>The other was that if the diurnal motion belonged to the
earth, it would
have to be so rapid that anyone placed at the bottom of a well would
not
for a moment be able to see a star which was directly above him, being
able to see it only during the very brief instant in which the earth
traverses
two or three yards, this being the width of the well. Yet experiment
shows
that the apparent passage of such a star in going over the well takes
quite
a while--a necessary argument that the mouth of the well does not move
with that rapidity which is required for the diurnal movement. Hence
the
earth is motionless.
      </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> Of these two arguments, the second really does
seem persuasive
to me; but as to the first, I think I could clear that up myself. For I
consider it the same thing for the terrestrial globe to move about its
own center and carry a mountain eastward with it, as for the globe to
stand
still while the mountain was detached at the base and drawn along the
earth.
And I do not see that carrying the mountain over the earth's surface is
an operation any different from sailing a ship over the surface of the
sea. So if the objection of the mountain were valid, it would follow I
ikeW`1'se that as the ship continued its voyage and became several
degrees
distant from our ports, we should have to climb its mast not merely in
order to ascend, but to move about in a plane, or eventually even to
descend.
Now this does not happen, nor have I ever heard of any sailor, even
among
those who have circumnavigated the globe, who had found any difference
in such actions (or any others performed on board ship) because of the
ship being in one place rather than another.
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> You argue very well, and if it had ever entered
the mind
of the author of this objection to consider how this neighoring eastern
mountain of his would, if the terrestrial globe revolved, be found in a
couple of hours to have been carried by that motion to where Mt.
Olympus,
for example, or Mt. Carmel is now located, he would have seen that by
his
own line of reasoning he would be obliged to believe and admit that in
order to get to the top of the latter mountains one would in fact have
to descend. Such people have the same kind of mind as do those who deny
the antipodes on the grounds that one cannot walk with his head down
and
his feet attached to the ceiling; they produce ideas that are true and
that they completely understand, but they do not find it easy to deduce
the simplest solutions for their difficulties. I mean, they understand
very well that to gravitate or to descend is to approach the center of
the terrestrial globe, and that to ascend is to depart from that; but
they
fail to understand that our antipodes have no trouble at all in
sustaining
themselves or in walking because they are just like us, having the
soles
of their feet toward the center of the earth and their heads toward the
sky.
      </p>
      <p><b>SAGR.</b> Yet we know that men who are profoundly ingenious
in other
fields are blind to such ideas. This confirms what I have just said; it
is good to remove every objection, even the feeblest. Therefore the
matter
of the well should also be answered.
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> This second argument does indeed have some
elusive appearance
of cogency. Nevertheless, I think it certain that if one were to
interrogate
the very person to whom it occurs, to the end that he might express
himself
better by explaining just what results ought to follow if one assumes
the
diurnal rotation of the earth, but which appear to him not to take
place;
then, I say, I believe that he would get all tangled up in explaining
this
question and its consequences--perhaps no less than he would
disentangle
it by thinking it over.
      </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> To be perfectly frank, I am sure that that is
what would
happen, although I too find myself right now in this same confusion.
For
at first glance it seems to me that the argument is binding, but on the
other hand I am beginning to realize that other troubles would arise if
the reasoning were to continue along the same line For this extremely
rapid
Course, which ought to be perceived in the star if the motion belonged
to the earth, should also be discovered in it if the motion were its
own--even
more so, since it would have to be thousands of times as fast in the
star
as in the earth. On the other hand, the star must be lost to sight by
passing
the mouth of the well, which would be only a couple of yards in
diameter,
if the well goes along with the earth more than two million yards per
hour.
Indeed, this seems to be such a transitory glimpse that one cannot even
imagine it; yet from the bottom of a well a star is seen for quite a
long
time. So I should like to be put in the clear about this matter.
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> Now I am strongly confirmed in my belief about
the confusion
of the author of this objection, seeing that you too, Simplicio,
becloud
what you mean and do not really grasp what you should be saying. I
deduce
this principally from your omitting a distinction which is a principal
point in this matter. So tell me whether in carrying out this
experiment
(I mean this one of the star passing over the mouth of the well) you
would
make any distinction between the well being deeper or shallower; that
is,
between the observer being farther from or closer to its mouth. For I
have
not heard you make any mention of this.
      </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> The fact is that I had not thought about it, but
your question
has awakened my mind to it, and hints to me that such a distinction
must
be quite necessary. Already I begin to see that in order to determine
the
time of the passage, the depth of the well may perhaps make no less
difference
than its width.
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> Still, I rather question whether the width makes
any difference
to us, or very much.
      </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> Why, it seems to me that having to travel 10
yards of breadth
takes ten times as long as to pass I yard. I am sure that a boat 10
yards
long will pass beyond my view long before a galley 100 yards long will
do so.
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> So, we still persist in that inveterate idea of
not moving
unless our legs carry us.
      </p>
      <p>What you are saying is true, my dear Simplicio, if the object
you see
is in motion while you remain stationary to observe it. But if you are
in a well when the well and you together are carried along by the
rotation
of the earth, don't you see that not in an hour, nor in a thousand, nor
in all eternity will you ever be overtaken by the mouth of the well?
The
manner in which the moving or nonmoving of the earth acts upon you in
such
a situation can be recognized not from the mouth of the well, but from
some other separate object not sharing the same state of motion--or I
should
say, of rest.
      </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> So far so good; but assume that I, being in the
well, am
carried together with it by the diurnal motion, and that the star seen
by me is motionless. The opening of the well (which alone allows my
sight
to pass beyond) being not more than three yards, out of so many
millions
of yards in the balance of the terrestrial surface which are hindering
my view, how can the time of my seeing be a perceptible fraction of
that
of my not seeing?
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> You are still falling into the same quibble, and
in fact
you will need someone to help you out of it. It is not the width of the
well, Simplicio, which measures the time of visibility of the star,
since
in that case you would see it perpetually, as the well would give
passage
to your vision perpetually. No, the measure of this time must be
obtained
from that fraction of the motionless heavens which remains visible
through
the opening of the well.
      </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> Is not that part of the sky which I perceive the
same fraction
of the entire heavenly sphere as the mouth of the well is of the
terrestrial
sphere?
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> I want you to answer that for yourself. Tell me
whether
the mouth of the well is always the same fraction of the earth's
surface.
      </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> There is no doubt that it is always the same.
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> And how about the part of the sky which is seen
by the
person in the well? Is that always the same fraction of the whole
celestial
sphere?
      </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> Now I am beginning to sweep the darkness from my
mind,
and to understand what you hinted to me a little while ago--that the
depth
of the well has something to do with this matter. For I do not question
that the more distant the eye is from the mouth of the well, the
smaller
Will be the part of the sky which it Will perceive, and consequently
the
sooner this will have been passed and become lost to view by whoever is
looking at it from the bottom of the well.
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> But is there any place in the well from which he
would
perceive exactly that fraction of the celestial sphere which the mouth
of the well is of the earth's surface?
      </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> It seems to me that if the well were excavated to
the center
of the earth, perhaps from there one might see a part of the sky which
would be to it as the well is to the earth. But leaving the center and
rising toward the surface, an ever larger part of the sky would be
revealed.
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> And finally, placing the eye at the mouth of the
well,
it would perceive one-half the sky, or very little less, which would
take
twelve hours in passing, assuming that we were at the equator. A while
ago I sketched for you an outline of the Copernican system, against the
truth of which the planet Mars launches a ferocious attack. For If it
were
true that the distances of Mars from the earth varied as much from
minimum
to maximum as twice the distance from the earth to the sun, then when
it
is closest to us its disc would have to look sixty times as large as
when
it is most distant. Yet no such difference is to be seen. Rather, when
it is in opposition to the sun and close to us, it shows itself as only
four or five times as large as when, at conjunction, it becomes hidden
behind the rays of the sun.
      </p>
      <p>Another and greater difficulty is made for us by Venus, which,
if it
circulates around the sun as Copernicus says, would be now beyond it
and
now on this side of it, receding from and approaching toward us by as
much
as the diameter of the circle it describes. Then when it is beneath the
sun and very close to us, its disc ought to appear to us a little less
than forty times as large as when it is beyond the sun and near
conjunction.
Yet the difference is almost imperceptible.
      </p>
      <p>Add to these another difficulty; for if the body of Venus is
intrinsically
dark, and like the moon it shines only by illumination from the sun,
which
seems reasonable, then it ought to appear homed when it is beneath the
sun, as the moon does when it is likewise near the sun--a phenomenon
which
does not make itself evident in Venus. For that reason, Copernicus
declared
that Venus was either luminous in itself or that its substance was such
that it could drink in the solar light and transmit this through its
entire
thickness in order that it might look resplendent to us. In this manner
Copernicus pardoned Venus its unchanging shape, but he said nothing
about
its small variation in size; much less of the requirements of Mars. I
believe
this was because he was unable to rescue to his own satisfaction an
appearance
so contradictory to his view, yet being persuaded by so many other
reasons,
he maintained that view and held it to be true.
      </p>
      <p>Besides these things, to have all the planets move around
together with
the earth, the sun being the center of their rotations, then the moon
alone
disturbing this order and having its own motion around the earth (going
around the sun in a year together with the earth and the whole
elemental
sphere) seems in some way to upset the whole order and to render it
improbable
and false.
      </p>
      <p>These are the difficulties which make me wonder at Aristarchus
and Copernicus.
They could not have helped noticing them, without having been able to
resolve
them; nevertheless they were confident of that which reason told them
must
be so in the light of many other remarkable observations. Thus they
confidently
affirmed that the structure of the universe could have no other form
than
that which they had described. Then there are other very serious but
beautiful
problems which are not easy for ordinary minds to resolve, but which
were
seen through and explained by Copernicus; these we shall put off until
we have answered the objections of people who show themselves hostile
to
this position.
      </p>
      <p>Coming now to the explanations and replies to the three grave
objections
mentioned, I say that the first two are not only not contrary to the
Copernican
system, but that they absolutely favor it, and greatly. For both Mars
and
Venus do show themselves variable in the assigned proportions, and
Venus
does appear homed when beneath the sun, and changes her shape in
exactly
the same way as the moon.
      </p>
      <p><b>SAGR.</b> But if this was concealed from Copemicus, how is
it revealed
to you?
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> These things can be comprehended only through the
sense
of sight, which nature has not granted so perfect to men that they can
succeed in discerning such distinctions. Rather, the very instrument of
seeing introduces a hindrance of its own. But in our time it has
pleased
God to concede to human ingenuity an invention so wonderful as to have
the power of increasing vision four, six, ten, twenty, thirty, and
forty
times, and an infinite number of objects which were invisible, either
because
of distance or extreme minuteness, have become visible by means of the
telescope.
      </p>
      <p><b>SAGR.</b> But Venus and Mars are not objects which are
invisible
because of any distance Or small size. We perceive these by simple
natural
vision. Why, then, do we not discern the differences in their sizes and
shapes?
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> In this the impediment of our eyes plays a large
part,
as I have just hinted to you. On account of that, bright distant
objects
are not represented to us as simple and plain, but are festooned with
adventitious
and alien rays which are so long and dense that the bare bodies are
shown
as expanded ten, twenty, a hundred, or a thousand times as much as
would
appear to us if the little radiant crown which is not theirs were
removed.
      </p>
      <p><b>SAGR.</b> Now I recall having read something of the sort,
but I don't
remember whether it was in the <i>Solar Letters</i> or in <i>Il
Saggiatore</i>
by our friend. <font size="-1">(note: Galileo.)</font> It would be a
good
thing, in order to refresh my memory as well as to inform Simplicio,
who
perhaps has not read those works, to explain to us in more detail how
the
matter stands. For I should think that a knowledge of this would be
most
essential to an understanding of what is now under discussion.
      </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> Everything that Salviati is presently setting
forth is
truly new to me. Frankly, I had no interest in reading those books, nor
up till now have I put any faith in the newly introduced optical
device.
Instead, following in the footsteps of other Peripatetic philosophers
of
my group, I have considered as fallacies and deceptions of the lenses
those
things which other people have admired as stupendous achievements. If I
have been in error, I shall be glad to be lifted out of it; and,
charmed
by the other new things I have heard from you, I shall listen most
attentively
to the rest.
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> The confidence which men of that stamp have in
their own
acumen is as unreasonable as the small regard they have for the
judgments
of others, It is a remarkable thing that they should think themselves
better
able to judge such an instrument without ever having tested it, than
those
who have made thousands and thousands of experiments with it and make
them
every day. But let us forget about such headstrong people, who cannot
even
be censured without doing them more honor than they deserve.
      </p>
      <p>Getting back to our purpose, I say that shining objects,
either because
their light is refracted in the moisture that covers the pupil, or
because
it is reflected from the edges of the eyelids and these reflected rays
are diffused over the pupil, or for some other reason, appear to our
eyes
as if surrounded by new rays. Hence these bodies look much larger than
they would if they were seen by us deprived of such irradiations. This
enlargement is made in greater and greater proportion as such luminous
objects become smaller and smaller, in exactly such a manner as if we
were
to suppose a growth of shining hair, say four inches long, to be added
around a circle four inches in diameter, which would increase its
apparent
size nine times; but ...
      </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> I think you meant to say "three times," since
four inches
added on each side of a circle four inches in diameter would amount to
tripling its magnitude and not to enlarging it nine times.
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> A little geometry, Simplicio; it is true that the
diameter
increases three times, but the surface (which is what we are talking
about)
grows nine times. For the surfaces of circles, Simplicio, are to each
other
as the squares of their diameters, and a circle four inches in diameter
has to another of twelve inches the same ratio which the square of four
has to the square of twelve; that is, 16 to 144. Therefore it will be
nine
times as large, not three. This is for your information, Simplicio.
      </p>
      <p>Now, to continue, if we add this coiffure of four inches to a
circle
of only two inches in diameter, the diameter of the crown will be ten
inches
and the ratio of the circle to the bare body will be as 100 to 4 (for
such
are the squares of 10 and of 2), so the enlargement would be
twenty-five
times. And finally, the four inches of hair added to a tiny circle of
one
inch in diameter would enlarge this eighty-one times. Thus the increase
is continually made larger and larger proportionately, according as the
real objects which are increased become smaller and smaller.
      </p>
      <p><b>SAGR.</b> The question which gave Simplicio trouble did not
really
bother me, but there are some other things about which I desire a
clearer
explanation. In particular I should like to team the basis upon which
you
affirm such a growth to be always equal in all Visible objects.
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> I have already partly explained by saying that
only luminous
objects increase; not dark ones. Now I shall add the rest. Of shining
objects,
those which are brightest in light make the greatest and strongest
reflections
upon our pupils, thereby showing themselves as much more enlarged than
those less bright. And so as not to go on too long about this detail,
let
us resort to what is shown us by our greatest teacher; this evening,
when
the sky is well darkened, let us look at Jupiter; we shall see it very
radiant and large. Then let us cause our vision to pass through a tube,
or even through a tiny opening which we may leave between the palm of
our
hand and our fingers, clenching the fist and bringing it to the eye; or
through a hole made by a fine needle in a card. We shall see the disc
of
Jupiter deprived of rays and so very small that we shall indeed judge
it
to be even less than one-sixtieth of what had previously appeared to us
to be a great torch when seen with the naked eye. Afterwards, we may
look
at the Dog Star, a very beautiful star and larger than any other fixed
star. To the naked eye it looks to be not much smaller than Jupiter,
but
upon taking away its headdress in the manner described above, its disc
will be seen to be so small that one would judge it to be no more than
one-twentieth the size of Jupiter. Indeed, a person lacking perfect
vision
will be able to find it only with great difficulty, from which it may
reasonably
be inferred that this star is one which has a great deal more
luminosity
than Jupiter, and makes larger irradiations.
      </p>
      <p>Next, the irradiations of the sun and of the moon are as
nothing because
of the size of these bodies, which by themselves take up so much room
in
our eye as to leave no place for adventitious rays, so that their discs
are seen as shorn and bounded.
      </p>
      <p>We may assure ourselves of the same fact by another experiment
which
I have made many times--assure ourselves, I mean, that the resplendent
bodies Of More vivid illumination give out many more rays than those
which
have only a pale light. I have often seen Jupiter and Venus together,
twenty-five
or thirty degrees from the sun, the sky being very dark. Venus would
appear
eight or even ten times as large as Jupiter when looked at with the
naked
eye. But seen afterward through a telescope, Jupiter's disc would be
seen
to be actually four or more times as large as Venus. Yet the liveliness
of Venus's brilliance was incomparably greater than the pale light of
Jupiter,
which comes about only because Jupiter is very distant from the sun and
from us, while Venus is close to us and to the sun.
      </p>
      <p>These things having been explained, it will not be difficult
to understand
how it might be that Mars, when in opposition to the sun and therefore
seven or more times as close to the earth as when it is near
conjunction,
looks to us scarcely four or five times as large in the former state as
in the latter. Nothing but irradiation is the cause of this. For if we
deprive it of the adventitious rays we shall find it enlarged in
exactly
the proper ratio. And to remove its head of hair from it, the telescope
is the unique and supreme means. Enlarging its disc nine hundred or a
thousand
times, it causes this to be seen bare and bounded like that of the
moon,
and in the two positions Varying in exactly the proper proportion.
      </p>
      <p>Next in Venus, which at its evening conjunction when it is
beneath the
sun ought to look almost forty times as large as in Its morning
conjunction,
and is seen as not even doubled, it happens in addition to the effects
of irradiation that it is sickle--shaped, and its horns, besides being
very thin, receive the sun's light obliquely and therefore very weakly.
So that because it is small and feeble, it makes its irradiations less
ample and lively than when it shows itself to us with its entire
hemisphere
lighted. But the telescope plainly shows us its horns to be as bounded
and distinct as those of the moon, and they are seen to belong to a
very
large circle, in a ratio almost forty times as great as the same disc
when
it is beyond the sun, toward the end of its morning appearances.
      </p>
      <p><b>SAGR.</b> Nicholas Copernicus, what a pleasure it would
have been
for you to see this part of your system confirmed by so clear an
experiment!
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> Yes, but how much less would his sublime
intellect be celebrated
among the learned! For as I said before, we may see that with reason as
his guide he resolutely continued to affirm what sensible experience
seemed
to contradict. I cannot get over my amazement that he was constantly
willing
to persist in saying that Venus might go around the sun and be more
than
six times as far from us at one time as at another, and still look
always
equal, when it should have appeared forty times larger.
      </p>
      <p><b>SAGR.</b> I believe then that in Jupiter, Saturn, and
Mercury one
ought also to see differences of size corresponding exactly to their
varying
distances.
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> In the two outer planets I have observed this
with precision
in almost every one of the past twenty-two years. In Mercury no
observations
of importance can be made, since it does not allow itself to be seen
except
at its maximum angles with the sun, in which the inequalities of its
distances
from the earth are imperceptible. Hence such differences are
unobservable,
and so are its changes of shape, which must certainly take place as in
Venus. But when we do see it, it would necessarily show itself to us in
the shape of a semicircle, just as Venus does at its maximum angles,
though
its disc is so small and its brilliance so lively that the power of the
telescope is not sufficient to strip off its hair so that it may appear
completely shorn.
      </p>
      <p>It remains for us to remove what would seem to be a great
objection
to the motion of the earth.. This is that though all the planets turn
about
the sun, the earth alone Is not solitary like the others, but goes
together
in the company of the moon and the whole elemental sphere around the
sun
in one year, while at the same time the moon moves around the earth
every
month. Here one must once more exclaim over and exalt the admirable
perspicacity
of Copernicus, and simultaneously regret his misfortune at not being
alive
in our day. For now Jupiter removes this apparent anomaly of the earth
and moon moving conjointly. We see Jupiter, like another earth, going
around
the sun in twelve years accompanied not by one but by four moons,
together
with everything that may be contained within the orbits of its four
satellites.
      </p>
      <p><b>SAGR.</b> And what is the reason for your calling the four
Jovian
planets "moons"?
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> That is what they would appear to be to anyone
who saw
them from Jupiter. For they are dark in themselves, and receive their
light
from the sun; this is obvious from their being eclipsed when they enter
into the cone of Jupiter's shadow. And since only that hemisphere of
theirs
is illuminated which faces the sun, they always look entirely
illuminated
to us who are outside their orbits and closer to the sun; but to anyone
on Jupiter they would look completely lighted only when they were at
the
highest points of their circles. In the lowest part--that is, when
between
Jupiter and the sun--they would appear homed from Jupiter. In a word,
they
would make for Jovians the same changes of shape which the moon makes
for
us Terrestrials.
      </p>
      <p>Now you see how admirably these three notes harmonize with the
Copernican
system, when at first they seemed so discordant with it. From this,
Simplicio
will be much better able to see with what great probability one may
conclude
that not the earth, but the sun, is the center of rotation of the
planets.
And since this amounts to placing the earth among the world bodies
which
indubitably move about the sun (above Mercury and Venus but beneath
Saturn,
Jupiter, and Mars), why will it not likewise be probable, or perhaps
even
necessary, to admit that it also goes around?
      </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> These events are so large and so conspicuous that
it is
impossible for Ptolemy and his followers not to have had knowledge of
them.
And having had, they must also have found a way to give reasons
sufficient
to account for such sensible appearances; congruous and probable
reasons,
since they have been accepted for so long by so many people.
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> You argue well, but you must know that the
principal activity
of pure astronomers is to give reasons just for the appearances of
celestial
bodies, and to fit to these and to the motions of the stars such a
structure
and arrangement of circles that the resulting calculated motions
correspond
with those same appearances. They are not much worried about admitting
anomalies which might in fact be troublesome in other respects.
Copernicus
himself writes, in his first studies, of having rectified astronomical
science upon the old Ptolemaic assumptions, and corrected the motions
of
the planets in such a way that the computations corresponded much
better
with the appearances, and vice versa. But this was still taking them
separately,
planet by planet. He goes on to say that when he wanted to put together
the whole fabric from all individual constructions, there resulted a
monstrous
chimera composed of mutually disproportionate members, incompatible as
a whole. Thus however well the astronomer might be satisfied merely as
a calculator, there was no satisfaction and peace for the astronomer as
a scientist. And since he very well understood that although the
celestial
appearances might be saved by means of assumptions essentially false in
nature, it would be very much better if he could derive them from true
suppositions, he set himself to inquiring diligently whether any one
among
the famous men of antiquity had attributed to the universe a different
structure from that of Ptolemy's which is commonly accepted. Finding
that
some of the Pythagoreans had in particular attributed the diurnal
rotation
to the earth, and others the annual revolution as well, he began to
examine
under these two new suppositions the appearances and peculiarities of
the
planetary motions, all of which he had readily at hand. And seeing that
the whole then corresponded to its parts with wonderful simplicity, he
embraced this new arrangement, and in it he found peace of mind.
      </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> But what anomalies are there in the Ptolemaic
arrangement
which are not matched by greater ones in the Copernican?
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> The illnesses are in Ptolemy, and the cures for
them in
Copernicus. First of all, do not all philosophical schools hold it to
be
a great Impropriety for a body having a natural circular movement to
move
irregularly with respect to its own center and regularly around another
point? Yet Ptolemy's structure is composed of such uneven movements,
while
in the Copernican system each movement is equable around its own
center.
With Ptolemy it is necessary to assign to the celestial bodies contrary
movements, and make everything move from east to west and at the same
time
from west to east, whereas with Copernicus all celestial revolutions
are
in one direction, from west to east. And what are we to say of the
apparent
movement of a planet, so uneven that it not only goes fast at one time
and slow at another, but sometimes stops entirely and even goes
backward
a long way after doing so? To save these appearances, Ptolemy
introduces
vast epicycles, adapting them one by one to each planet, with certain
rules
about incongruous motions--all of which can be done away with by one
very
simple motion of the earth. Do you not think it extremely absurd,
Simplicio,
that in Ptolemy's construction where all planets are assigned their own
orbits, one above another, it should be necessary to say that Mars,
placed
above the sun's sphere, often falls so far that it breaks through the
sun's
orb, descends below this and gets closer to the earth than the body of
the sun is, and then a little later soars immeasurably above it? Yet
these
and other anomalies are cured by a single and simple annual movement of
the earth.
      </p>
      <p><b>SAGR.</b> I should like to arrive at a better understanding
of how
these stoppings, retrograde motions, and advances, which have always
seemed
to me highly improbable, come about in the Copernican system.
      </p>

      </center>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> Sagredo, you will see them come about in such a
way that
the theory of this alone ought to be enough to gain assent for the rest
of the doctrine from anyone who is neither stubborn nor unteachable. I
tell you, then, that no change occurs in the movement of Saturn in
thirty
years, in that of Jupiter in twelve, that of Mars in two, Venus in nine
months, or in that of Mercury in about eighty days. The annual movement
of the earth alone, between Mars and Venus, causes all the apparent
irregularities
of the five stars named. For an easy and full understanding of this, I
wish to draw you a picture of it. Now suppose the sun to be located in
the center 0, around which we shall designate the orbit described by
the
earth with its annual movement, BGM. The circle described by Jupiter
(for
example) in 12 years will be <i>BGM</i> here, and in the stellar
sphere
we shall take the circle of the zodiac to be <i>PUA</i>. In addition,
in
the earth's annual orbit we shall take a few equal arcs, BC, CD, DE,
EF,
FG, GH, H1, IK, KL, and LK and in the circle of Jupiter we shall
indicate
these other arcs passed over in the same times in which the earth is
passing
through these. These are <i>BC, CD, DR, EF, FG, GH, Hf, IK, KL,</i>
and
      <i>LM,</i>
which will be proportionately smaller than those noted on the earth's
orbit,
as the motion of Jupiter through the zodiac is slower than the annual
celestial
motion.
      </p>
      <p>Now suppose that when the earth is at B, Jupiter is at <i>B</i>,
then
it will appear to us as being in the zodiac at <i>P</i>, along the
straight
line B<i>BP</i>. Next let the earth move from B to C and Jupiter from B
to C in the same time; to us, Jupiter will appear to have arrived at <i>Q</i>
in the zodiac, having advanced in the order of the signs from <i>P</i>
to <i>Q</i>. The earth then passing to D and Jupiter to <i>D</i>, it
will
be seen in the zodiac at <i>R</i>; and from E, Jupiter being at <i>E</i>,
it will appear in the zodiac at S, still advancing. But now when the
earth
begins to get directly between Jupiter and the sun (having arrived at F
and Jupiter at <i>F</i>), to us Jupiter will appear to be ready to
commence
returning backward through the zodiac, for during the time in which the
earth will have passed through the arc EF, Jupiter will have been
slowed
down between the points S and T, and will look to us almost stationary.
Later the earth coming to G, Jupiter at <i>G</i> (in opposition to the
sun) will be seen in the zodiac at <i>U</i>, turned far back through
the
whole arc <i>TU</i> in the zodiac; but in reality, following always
its
uniform course, it has advanced not only in its own circle but in the
zodiac
too, with respect to the center of the zodiac and to the sun which is
located
there.
      </p>
      <p>The earth and Jupiter then continuing their movements, when
the earth
is at H and Jupiter is at <i>H</i>, It will be seen as having returned
far back through the zodiac by the whole arc <i>UX</i>; but the earth
having
arrived at I and Jupiter at <i>I</i>, it will apparently have moved in
the zodiac by only the small space <i>XY</i> and will there appear
stationary.
Then when the earth shall have progressed to K and Jupiter to <i>K</i>,
Jupiter will have advanced through the arc <i>YN</i>, in the zodiac;
and,
continuing its course, from L the earth will see Jupiter at <i>L</i>
in
the point Z Finally, Jupiter at <i>M</i> will be seen from the earth
at
M to have passed to A, still advancing. And its whole apparent
retrograde
motion in the zodiac will be as much as the arc <i>TX</i>, made by
Jupiter
while it is passing in its own circle through the arc <i>FH</i>, the
earth
going through FH in its orbit.
      </p>
      <p>Now what is said here of Jupiter is to be understood of Saturn
and Mars
also. In Saturn these retrogressions are somewhat more frequent than in
Jupiter, because its motion is slower than Jupiter's, so that the earth
overtakes it in a shorter time. In Mars they are rarer, its motion
being
faster than that of Jupiter, so that the earth spends more time in
catching
up with it.
      </p>
      <p>Next, as to Venus and Mercury, whose circles are included
within that
of the earth, stoppings and retrograde motions appear in them also, due
not to anv motion that really exists in them, but to the annual motion
of the earth. This is acutely demonstrated by Copernicus, enlisting the
aid of Apollonius of Perga, in chapter 35 of Book V in his <i>Revolutions</i>.
      </p>
      <p>You see, gentlemen, with what ease and simplicity the annual
motion--if
made by the earth--lends itself to supplying reasons for the apparent
anomalies
which are observed in the movements of the five planets, Saturn,
Jupiter,
Mars, Venus, and Mercury. It removes them all and reduces these
movements
to equable and regular motions; and it was Nicholas Copernicus who
first
clarified for us the reasons for this marvelous effect.
      </p>
      <p>But another effect, no less wonderful than this, and
containing a knot
perhaps even more difficult to untie, forces the human intellect to
admit
this annual rotation and to grant it to our terrestrial globe. This is
a new and unprecedented theory touching the sun itself For the sun has
shown itself unwilling to stand alone in evading the confirmation of so
important a conclusion, and instead wants to be the greatest witness of
all to this, beyond exception. So now hear this new and mighty
marvel....
      </p>
      <p>...This, Simplicio, is all that occurred to my friend and to
myself
regarding that which might be adduced in explanation of the appearances
in defense of their opinions by the Copernicans and by the Ptolemaics.
You may do with it whatever your own judgment persuades you to do.
      </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> I recognize my own incapacity to take upon myself
so important
a decision. As to my own ideas, I remain neutral, in the hope that a
time
Will come when the mind will be freed by an illumination from higher
contemplations
than these of our human reasoning, and all the mists which keep it
darkened
will be swept away.
      </p>
      <p><b>SAGR.</b> Simplicio's counsel is excellent and pious, and
worthy
of being accepted and followed by everyone, since only that which is
derived
from the highest wisdom and supreme authority may be embraced with
complete
security. But so far as human reason is allowed to penetrate, confining
myself within the bounds of theory and of probable causes, I shall
indeed
say (with a little more boldness than Simplicio exhibits) that I have
not,
among all the many profundities that I have ever heard, met with
anything
which is more wonderful to my intellect or has more decisively captured
my mind (outside of pure geometrical and arithmetical proofs) than
these
two conjectures, one of which is taken from the stoppings and
retrograde
motions of the five planets, and the other from the peculiarities of
movement
of the sunspots. And it appears to me that they yield easily and
clearly
the true cause of such strange phenomena, showing the reason for such
phenomena
to be a simple motion which is mixed with many others that are also
simple
but that differ among themselves. Moreover they show this without
introducing
any difficulties; rather, they remove all those which accompany other
viewpoints.
So much so that I am rapidly coming to the conclusion that those who
remain
hostile toward this doctrine must either not have heard it or must not
have understood these arguments, which are so numerous and so
conclusive.
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> I do not give these arguments the status of
either conclusiveness
or of inconclusiveness, since (as I have said before) my intention has
not been to solve anything about this momentous question, but merely to
set forth those physical and astronomical reasons which the two sides
can
give me to set forth. I leave to others the decision, which ultimately
should not be ambiguous, since one of the arrangements must be true and
the other false. Hence it is not possible within the bounds of human
learning
that the reasons adopted by the right side should be anything but
clearly
conclusive, and those opposed to them, vain and ineffective.
      </p>
      <p><b>SAGR.</b> Then it is now time for us to hear the other
side, from
that booklet of theses or disquisitions which Simplicio has brought
back
with him.
      </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> Here is the book, and here is the place in which
the author
first briefly describes the system of the world according to the
position
of Copernicus, saying: <i>Terram igitur una cum Luna lotoque hoc
elementari
Copernicus</i> etc. ("Therefore the earth, together with the moon and
all
this elemental world, Copernicus" etc.)
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> Wait a bit, Simplicio; for it seems to me that
this author
at the very outset declares himself to be very ill-informed about the
position
he undertakes to refute, when he says that Copernicus makes the earth
together
with the moon trace out the orbis magnnus in a year, moving from east
to
west; a thing which, as it is false and impossible, has accordingly
never
been uttered by Copernicus. Indeed, he makes it go in the opposite
direction
(I mean from west to east; that is, in the ord6r of the signs of the
zodiac),
so that it appears that the annual motion belongs to the sun, which 'is
placed immovably in the center of the zodiac.
      </p>
      <p>You see the excessive boldness of this man's self-confidence,
setting
himself up to refute another's doctrine while remaining ignorant of the
basic foundations upon which the greatest and most important parts of
the
whole structure are supported. This is a poor beginning for gaining the
confidence of the reader, but let us proceed.
      </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> The system of the universe explained, he begins
to propose
his objections against the annual movement. The first of these he
utters
ironically, in derision of Copernicus and his followers, writing that
in
this fantastic arrangement of the world one must affirm the most
sublime
inanities: That the sun, Venus, and Mercury are beneath the earth; that
heavy material naturally ascends and light stuff descends; that Christ,
our Saviour and Redeemer, rose to hell and descended into heaven when
He
approached the sun. That when Joshua commanded the sun to stand still,
the earth stood still--or else the sun moved opposite to the earth;
that
when the sun is in Cancer, the earth is running through Capricorn, so
that
the winter signs make the summer and the spring signs the autumn; that
the stars do not rise and set for the earth, but the earth for them;
and
that the east starts in the west while the west begins in the east; in
a word, that nearly the whole course of the world is turned inside out.
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> All of this is satisfactory to me except his
having mixed
passages from the ever venerable and mighty Holy Scriptures among these
apish puerilities, and his having tried to utilize sacred things for
wounding
anybody who might, without either affirming or denying anything,
philosophize
Jokingly and in sport, having made certain assumptions and desiring to
argue about them among friends.
      </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> Truly he scandalized me too, and not a little;
especially
later, when he adds that if indeed the Copernicans answer these and the
like arguments in some distorted way, they still will not be able to
answer
satisfactorily some things which come later.
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> Oh, that is worst of all, for he is pretending to
have
things which are more effective and convincing than the authority of
Holy
Writ. But let us, for our part, revere it, and pass on to physical and
human arguments. Yet if he does not adduce among his physical arguments
matters which make more sense than those set forth up to this point, we
may as well abandon him entirely. I am certainly not in favor of
wasting
words answering such trifling tomfooleries. And as for his saying that
the Copernicans do reply to these objections, that is quite false. I
cannot
believe that any man would put himself to such a pointless waste of
time.
      </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> I, too, concur in this decision, let us, then,
listen to
his other objections, which are more strongly supported. Now here, as
you
see, he deduces with very precise calculations that if the orbit in
which
Copernicus makes the earth travel
      </p>
      <p>Around the sun in a year were scarcely perceptible with
respect to the
immensity of the stellar sphere, as Copernicus says must be assumed,
then
one would have to declare and maintain that the fixed stars were at an
inconceivable distance from us, and that the smallest of them would be
much larger than this whole orbit, while others would be larger than
the
orbit of Saturn. Yet such bulks are truly too vast, and are
incomprehensible
and unbelievable.
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> I have indeed seen something similar argued
against Copernicus
by Tycho, so this is not the first time that I have revealed the
fallacy--or
better, the fallacies--of this argument, built as it is upon completely
false hypotheses. It is based upon a dictum of Copernicus which is
taken
by his adversaries with rigorous literalness, as do those quarrelsome
people
who, being wrong about the principal issue of the case, seize upon some
single word accidentally uttered by their opponents and make a great
fuss
about it without ever letting up.
      </p>
      <p>For your better comprehension, know that Copernicus first
explains the
remarkable consequences to the various planets deriving from the annual
movement of the earth; in particular the forward and retrograde
movements
of the three outer planets. Then he adds that these apparent mutations
which are perceived to be greater in Mars than in Jupiter, from
Jupiter's
being more distant, and still less in Saturn, from its being farther
away
than Jupiter, remain imperceptible in the fixed stars because of their
immense distance from us in comparison with the distance of Jupiter or
of Saturn. Here the adversaries of this opinion rise up, and take what
Copernicus has called "imperceptible" as having been assumed by him to
be really and absolutely nonexistent. Remarking that even the smallest
of the fixed stars is still perceptible, since it strikes our sense of
sight, they set themselves to calculating (with the Introduction of
still
more false assumptions), and deduce that in Copernicus's doctrine one
must
admit that a fixed star is much larger than the orbit of the earth.
      </p>
      <p>Now in order to reveal the folly of their entire method, I
shall show
that by assuming that a star of the sixth magnitude may be no larger
than
the sun, one may deduce by means of correct demonstrations that the
distance
of the fixed stars from us is sufficiently great to make quite
imperceptible
in them the annual movement of the earth which in turn causes such
large
and observable variations in the planets. Simultaneously I shall
clearly
expose to you a gigantic fallacy in the assumptions made by the
adversaries
of Copernicus.
      </p>
      <p>To begin with, I assume along with Copernicus and in agreement
with
his opponents that the radius of the earth's orbit, which is the
distance
from the sun to the earth, contains 1,208 of the earth's radii.
Secondly,
I assume with the same concurrence and in accordance with the truth
that
the apparent diameter of the sun at its average distance is about
one-half
a degree, or 300 minutes; this is 1,800 seconds, or 108,000 third-order
divisions. And since the apparent diameter of a fixed star of the first
magnitude is no more than 5 seconds, or 300 thirds, and the diameter of
one of the sixth magnitude measures 50 thirds (and here is the greatest
error of Copernicus's adversaries), then the diameter of the sun
contains
the diameter of a fixed star of the sixth magnitude 2,160 times.
Therefore
if one assumes that a fixed star of the sixth magnitude is really equal
to the sun and not larger, this amounts to saying that if the sun moved
away until its diameter looked to be 1/2160th of what it now appears to
be, its distance would have to be 2,160 times what it is In fact now.
      </p>
      <p>This is the same as to say that the distance of a fixed star
of the
sixth magnitude is 2,160 radii of the earth's orbit. And since the
distance
from the earth to the sun is commonly granted to contain 1,208 radii of
the earth, and the distance of the fixed star is, as we said, 2,160
radii
of the orbit, then the radius of the earth in relation to that of its
orbit
is much greater than (almost double) the radius of that orbit in
relation
to the stellar sphere. Therefore the difference in aspect of the fixed
star caused by the diameter of the earth's orbit would be little more
noticeable
than that which is observed in the sun due to the radius of the earth.
      <font size="-1">(note:
Galileo's numbers are Inaccurate, but serve the purposes of his
argument;
he seriously underestimated stellar distance, but nevertheless placed
the
stars well beyond more typical estimations made by those he proceeds to
mention.)</font>
      </p>
      <p><b>SAGR.</b> For a first step, this Is a bad fall.
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> It is indeed wrong, since according to this
author a star
of the sixth magnitude would have to be as large as the earth's orbit
in
order to justify the dictum of Copernicus. Yet assuming it to be equal
only to the sun, which in turn is rather less than one ten-millionth of
that orbit, makes the stellar sphere so large and distant that this
alone
is sufficient to remove this objection against Copernicus.
      </p>
      <p><b>SAGR.</b> Please make this computation for me.
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> The calculation is very short and simple. The
diameter
of the sun is 11 radii of the earth, and the diameter of the earth's
orbit
contains 2,416 of these radii, as both parties agree. So the diameter
of
the orbit contains that of the sun approximately 220 times, and since
spheres
are to each other as the cubes of their diameters, we take the cube of
220 and we have the orbit 10,648,000 times as large as the sun. The
author
would say that a star of the sixth magnitude would have to be equal to
this orbit.
      </p>
      <p><b>SAGR.</b> Then their error consists in their having been
very much
deceived in taking the apparent diameter of the fixed stars.
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> That is the error, but not the only one. And
truly I am
quite surprised at the number of astronomers, and famous ones too, who
have been quite mistaken in their determinations of the sizes of the
fixed
as well as the moving stars, only the two great luminaries being
excepted.
Among these men are al-Fergani, al-Battani, Thabit ben Korah, and more
recently Tycho, Clavius, and all the predecessors of our Academician.
For
they did not take care of the adventitious irradiation which
deceptively
makes the stars look a hundred or more times as large as they are when
seen without haloes. Nor can these men be excused for their
carelessness;
it was within their power to see the bare stars at their pleasure, for
it suffices to look at them when they first appear in the evening, or
just
before they vanish at dawn. And Venus, if nothing else, should have
warned
them of their mistake, being frequently seen in daytime so small that
it
takes sharp eyesight to see it, though in the following night it
appears
like a great torch. I Will not believe that they thought the true disc
of a torch was as It appears in profound darkness, rather than as it is
when perceived in lighted surroundings; for our lights seen from afar
at
night look large, but from near at hand their true flames are seen to
be
small and circumscribed. This alone might have sufficed to make them
cautious.
      </p>
      <p>To speak quite frankly, I thoroughly believe that none of
them--not
even Tycho himself, accurate as he was in handling astronomical
instruments
and despite his having built such large and accurate ones without a
thought
for their enormous expense--ever set himself to determine and measure
the
apparent diameter of any star except the sun and moon. I think that
arbitrarily
and, so to speak, by rule of thumb some one among the most ancient
astronomers
stated that such-and-such was the case, and the later ones without any
further experiment adhered to what this first one had declared. For if
any of them had applied himself to making any test of the matter, he
would
doubtless have detected the error.
      </p>
      <p><b>SAGR.</b> But if they lacked the telescope (for you have
already
said that our friend came to know the truth of the matter by means of
that
instrument), they ought to be pardoned, not accused of negligence.
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> That would be true if they could not have
obtained the
result without the telescope. It Is true that the telescope, by showing
the disc of the star bare and very many times enlarged, renders the
operations
much easier, but one could carry them on without it, though not with
the
same accuracy. I have done so, and this is the method I have used. I
hung
up a light rope in the direction of a star (I made use of Vega, which
rises
between the north and the northeast) and then by approaching and
retreating
from this cord placed between me and the star, I found the point where
its width just hid the star from me. This done, I found the distance of
my eye from the cord, which amounts to the same thing as one of the
sides
which includes the angle formed at my eye and extending over the
breadth
of the cord....
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> Simplicio, I wish you could for a moment put
aside your
affection for the followers of your doctrines and tell me frankly
whether
you believe that they comprehend in their own minds this magnitude
which
they subsequently decide cannot be ascribed to the universe because of
its immensity. I myself believe that they do not. It seems to me that
here
the situation is just as it is with the grasp of numbers when one gets
up into the thousands of millions, and the imagination becomes confused
and can form no concept. The same thing happens in comprehending the
magnitudes
of immense distances; there comes into our reasoning an effect similar
to that which occurs to the senses on a serene night, when I look at
the
stars and judge by sight that their distance is but a few miles, or
that
the fixed stars are not a bit farther off than Jupiter, Saturn, or even
the moon.
      </p>
      <p>But aside from all this, consider those previous disputes
between the
astronomers and the Peripatetic philosophers about the reasoning as to
the distance of the new stars in Cassiopeia and Sagittarius, the
astronomers
placing these among the fixed stars and the philosophers believing them
to be closer than the moon. How powerless are our senses to distinguish
large distances from extremely large ones, even when the latter are in
fact many thousands of times the larger!
      </p>
      <p>And finally I ask you, O foolish man: Does your imagination
first comprehend
some magnitude for the universe, which you then judge, to be too vast?
If it does, do you like imagining that your comprehension extends
beyond
the Divine power? Would you like to imagine to yourself things greater
than God can accomplish? And if it does not comprehend this, then why
do
you pass judgment upon things you do not understand?
      </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> These arguments are very good, and no one denies
that the
size of the heavens may exceed our imaginings, since God could have
created
it even thousands of times larger than it is. But must we not admit
that
nothing has been created in vain, or is idle, in the universe? Now when
we see this beautiful order among the planets, they being arranged
around
the earth at distances commensurate with their producing upon it their
effects for our benefit, to what end would there then be interposed
between
the highest of their orbits (namely, Saturn's), and the stellar sphere,
a vast space without anything in it, superfluous, and vain? For the use
and convenience of whom?
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> It seems to me that we take too much upon
ourselves, Simplicio,
when we will have it that merely taking care of us is the adequate work
of Divine wisdom and power, and the limit beyond which it creates and
disposes
of nothing.
      </p>
      <p>I should not like to have us tie its hand so. We should be
quite content
in the knowledge that God and Nature are so occupied with the
government
of human affairs that they could not apply themselves more to us even
if
they had no other cares to attend to than those of the human race
alone.
I believe that I can explain what I mean by a very appropriate and most
noble example, derived from the action of the light of the sun. For
when
the sun draws up some vapors here, or warms a plant there, it draws
these
and warms this as if it had nothing else to do. Even in ripening a
bunch
of grapes, or perhaps just a single grape, it applies itself so
effectively
that it could not do more even if the goal of all its affairs were just
the ripening of this one grape. Now if this grape receives from the sun
everything it can receive, and is not deprived of the least thing by
the
sun simultaneously producing thousands and thousands of other results,
then that grape would be guilty of pride or envy if it believed or
demanded
that the action of the sun's rays should be employed upon itself alone.
      </p>
      <p>I am certain that Divine Providence omits none of the things
which look
to the government of human affairs, but I cannot bring myself to
believe
that there may not be other things in the universe dependent upon the
infinity
of its wisdom, at least so far as my reason informs me; yet if the
facts
were otherwise, I should not resist believing in reasoning which I had
borrowed from a higher understanding. Meanwhile, when I am told that an
immense space interposed between the planetary orbits and the starry
sphere
would be useless and vain, being idle and devoid of stars, and that any
immensity going beyond our comprehension would be superfluous for
holding
the fixed stars, I say that it is brash for our feebleness to attempt
to
judge the reason for God's actions, and to call everything in the
universe
vain and superfluous which does not serve us.
      </p>
      <p><b>SAGR.</b> Say rather, and I think you will be speaking more
accurately,
"which we do not know to serve us." I believe that one of the greatest
pieces of arrogance. or rather madness, that can be thought of is to
say,
"Since I do not know how Jupiter or Saturn is of service to me, they
are
superfluous, and even do not exist." Because, O deluded man, neither do
I know how my arteries are of service to me, nor my cartilages, spleen,
or gall, I should not even know that I had gall, or a spleen, or
kidneys,
if they had not been shown to me in many dissected corpses. Even then I
could understand what my spleen does for me only if it were removed. In
order to understand how some celestial body acted upon me (since you
want
ail their actions to be directed at me), it would be necessary to
remove
that body for a while, and say that whatever effect I might then feel
to
be missing in me depended upon that star.
      </p>
      <p>Besides, what does it mean to say that the space between
Saturn and
the fixed stars, which these men call too vast and useless, is empty of
world bodies? That we do not see them, perhaps? Then did the four
satellites
of Jupiter and the companions of Saturn come into the heavens when we
began
seeing them, and not before? Were there not innumerable other fixed
stars
before men began to see them"The nebulae were once only little white
patches;
have we with our telescopes made them become clusters of many bright
and
beautiful stars? Oh, the presumptuous, rash ignorance of mankind!
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> There is no need, Sagredo, to probe any farther
into their
fruitless exaggerations. Let us continue our plan, which is to examine
the validity of the arguments brought forward by each side without
deciding
anything, leaving the decision to those who know more about it than we.
      </p>
      <p>Returning to our natural and human reason, I say that these
terms "large,"
"small" "immense," "minute," etc. are not absolute, but relative; the
same
thing in comparison with various others may be called at one time
"immense"
and at another "Imperceptible," let alone "small." Such being the case,
I ask: In relation to what can the stellar sphere of Copernicus be
called
too vast? So far as I can see, it cannot be compared or said to be too
vast except in relation to some other thing of the same kind. Now let
us
take the smallest thing of the same kind, which will be the orbit of
the
moon. If the stellar orb must be considered too vast in relation to
that
of the moon, then every other magnitude which exceeds some other of its
kind by a similar or greater ratio ought also to be said to be too
vast;
and likewise, by the same reasoning, it should be said not to exist in
the universe. Then the elephant and the whale will be mere chimeras and
poetical fictions, because the former are too vast in comparison with
ants
(being land animals), and the latter in relation to gudgeons (being
fish).
And if actually found in nature, they would be immeasurably large; for
the elephant and whale certainly exceed the ant and gudgeon in a much
greater
ratio than the stellar sphere does that of the moon, taking the stellar
sphere to he as large as is required by the Copernican system.
      </p>
      <p>Besides, how large is the sphere of Jupiter, and how great is
that assigned
to Saturn as the receptacle of a single star, though the planet itself
is small in comparison with a fixed star! Surely if to each fixed star
such a large portion of the space in the universe should be assigned as
its container, that orb which contains an innumerable quantity of these
would have to he made many thousands of times larger than suffices for
the needs of Copernicus. Moreover, do you not call a fixed star very
small--I
mean even one of the most conspicuous ones, let alone those which
escape
our sight? And we call it so in comparison with the surrounding space.
Now if the whole stellar sphere were one single blazing body, who is
there
that does not understand that in an infinite space there could be
assigned
a distance so great that, from there, such a brilliant sphere would
appear
as small as or even smaller than a fixed star now appears to us from
the
earth? So from such a point we should judge as small the very things
which
we now call immeasurably huge.
      </p>
      <p><b>SAGR.</b> To me, a great ineptitude exists on the part of
those who
would have it that God made the universe more in proportion to the
small
capacity of their reason than to Ms immense, His infinite, power.
      </p>
      <p><b>SEMP.</b> All this that you are saying is good, but what
the other
side objects to is having to grant that a fixed star must be not only
equal
to, but much greater than, the sun; for both are still individual
bodies
located within the stellar orb. And it seems to me much to the purpose
that this author inquires, "To what end and use are such vast frames?
Produced
for the earth, perhaps? That is, for a trifling little dot? And why so
remote as to appear very small and be absolutely unable to act in any
way
upon the earth? To what purpose such a disproportionately large abyss
between
these and Saturn? All these things are baffling, for they cannot be
maintained
by probable reasons."
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> From the questions this fellow asks, it seems to
me that
one may deduce that if only the sky, the stars, and their distances
were
permitted to keep the sizes and magnitudes which he has believed in up
to this point (though he has surely never imagined for them any
comprehensible
magnitudes), then he would completely understand and be satisfied about
the benefits which would proceed from them to the earth, which itself
would
no longer be such a trifling thing. Nor would these stars any longer be
so remote as to seem quite minute, but large enough to be able to act
upon
the earth. And the distance between them and Saturn would be in good
proportion,
and he would have Very probable reasons for everything, which I should
very much like to have heard. But seeing how confused and contradictory
he is in these few words leads me to believe that he is very thrifty
with
or else hard up for these probable reasons, and that what he calls
reasons
are more likely fallacies, even shadows of foolish fantasies. Therefore
I ask him whether these celestial bodies really act upon the earth, and
whether
it was for that purpose that they were made of such-and-such sizes and
arranged at such-and-such distances, or whether they have nothing to do
with terrestrial affairs? If they have nothing to do with the earth,
then
it is a great folly for us Terrestrials to want to be arbiters of their
sizes and regulators of their local dispositions, we being quite
ignorant
of all their affairs and interests. But if he says that they do act,
and
that it is to this end that they are directed, then this amounts to
admitting
what he denies in another place, and praising what he has just finished
condemning when he said that celestial bodies located at such distances
from the earth as to appear minuscule could not act upon it in any way.
Now, my good man, in the starry sphere, which is already established at
whatever distance it is, and which you have just decided is well
proportioned
for an influence upon terrestrial matters, a multitude of stars do
appear
quite small, and a hundred times as many are entirely invisible to
us--which
is to appear smaller than small. Therefore you must now (contradicting
yourself) deny their action upon the earth, or else (still
contradicting
yourself) admit that their appearing small does not detract from their
power to act. Or else (and this would be a frank and honest confession)
you must grant and freely admit that your judgment about their sizes
and
distances was folly, not to say presumption or brashness.
      </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> As a matter of fact, I also saw immediately, upon
reading
this passage, the obvious contradiction in his saying that the stars of
Copernicus, so to speak, could not act upon the earth because they
appeared
so small, and his not noticing that he had granted action upon the
earth
to the stars of Ptolemy and his own, these not merely appearing small
but
being for the most part invisible.
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> But now I come to another point. Upon what basis
does he
say that the stars appear so smaII? Is it perhaps because that is the
way
they look to us? Does he not know that this comes about from the
instrument
which we use in looking at them--that is, our eyes? Or for that matter
that by changing instruments we may see them larger and larger, as much
as we please? Who knows; perhaps to the earth, which beholds them
without
eyes, they may appear quite huge and as they really are?
      </p>
      <p>But it is time for us to leave these trifles and get to more
important
matters. I have already demonstrated two things: first, at what
distance
the firmament may be placed so that the diameter of the earth's orbit
would
make no greater variation in it than that which the terrestrial
diameter
makes with respect to the sun at its distance therefrom, and I then
showed
that in order to make a fixed star appear to us as of the size we see,
it is not necessary to assume it to be larger than the sun. Now I
should
like to know whether Tycho or any of his disciples has ever tried to
investigate
in any way whether any phenomenon is perceived in the stellar sphere by
which one might boldly affirm or deny the annual motion of the earth.
      </p>
      <p><b>SAGR.</b> I should answer "no" for them, they having had no
need
to do so, since Copernicus himself says that there is no such variation
there; and they, arguing <i>ad hominem</i>, grant this to him. Then on
this assumption they show the improbability which follows from it;
namely,
it would be required to make the sphere so immense that in order for a
fixed star to look as large as it does, it would actually have to be so
immense in bulk as to exceed the earth's orbit--a thing which is, as
they
say, entirely unbelievable. SALV. So it seems to me, and I believe that
they argue against the man more in the defense of another man than out
of any great desire to get at the truth. And not only do I believe that
none of them ever applied himself to making such observations, but I am
not even sure that any of them knew what variation ought to be produced
in the fixed stars by the annual movement of the earth, if the stellar
sphere were not at such a distance that any variation in them would
vanish
on account of its smallness. For to stop short of such researches and
fall
back upon the mere dictum of Copernicus may suffice to refute the man,
but certainly not to clear up the fact.
      </p>
      <p>Now it might be that there is a variation, but that it Is not
looked
for; or that because of its smallness, or through lack of accurate
instruments,
it was not known by Copernicus. <font size="-1">(note: Stellar
parallax will
not be detected until 1837.) </font>This would not be the first thing
that
he failed to know, either for lack of instruments or from some other
deficiency.
Yet, grounded upon most solid theories, he affirmed what seemed to be
contradicted
by things he did not understand. For as already said, without a
telescope
it cannot be comprehended that Mars does increase sixty times and Venus
forty times in one position as against another, and their differences
appeared
to be much less than the true ones. Yet since that time it has become
certain
that such variations are, to a hair, Just what the Copernican system
required.
Hence it would be a good thing to investigate with the greatest
possible
precision whether one could really observe such a variation as ought to
be perceived in the fixed stars, assuming an annual motion of the
earth....
      </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> Really, to be quite frank, I do feel a great
repugnance
against having to concede the distance of the fixed stars to be so
great
that the alterations just explained would have to remain entirely
imperceptible
in them.
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> Do not completely despair, Simplicio; perhaps
there is
yet some way of tempering your difficulties. First of all, that the
apparent
size of the stars is not seen to alter visibly need not appear entirely
improbable to you when you see that men's estimates in such a matter
may
be so grossly in error, particularly when looking at brilliant objects.
Looking, for example, at a burning torch from a distance of two hundred
paces, and then coming closer by three or four yards, do you believe
that
you yourself would perceive it as larger? For my part, I should
certainly
not discover this even if I approached by twenty or thirty paces;
sometimes
I have even happened to see such a light at a distance, and been unable
to decide whether it was coming toward me or going away, when in fact
it
was approaching. Now what of this? If the same approach and retreat of
Saturn (I mean double the distance from the sun to us) is almost
entirely
imperceptible, and if it is scarcely noticeable in Jupiter, what could
it amount to in the fixed stars, which I believe you would not hesitate
to place twice as far away as Saturn? In Mars, which while approaching
us. . .
      </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> Please do not labor this point, for I am indeed
convinced
that what you have said about the unaltered appearance of the apparent
sizes of the fixed stars may very well be the case. But what shall we
say
to that other difficulty which arises from no variation at all being
seen
in their changing aspects?
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> Let us say something which will perhaps satisfy
you also
on this point. Briefly, would you be content if those alterations
really
were perceived in the stars which seem to you so necessary if the
annual
motion belongs to the earth?
      </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> I should indeed be, so far as this particular is
concerned.
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> I wish you had said that if such a variation were
perceived,
nothing would remain that could cast doubt upon the earth's mobility,
since
no counter could be found to such an event. But even though this may
not
make itself visible to us, the earth's mobility Is not thereby
excluded,
nor its immobility necessarily proved. It is possible, Copernicus
declares,
that the immense distance of the starry sphere makes such small
phenomena
unobservable. And as has already been remarked, it may be that up to
the
present they have not even been looked for, or, if looked for, not
sought
out in such a way as they need to be; that is, with all necessary
precision
and minute accuracy. It is hard to achieve this precision, both on
account
of the imperfection of astronomical instruments, which are subject to
much
variation, and because of the shortcomings of those who handle them
with
less care than is required. A cogent reason for putting little faith in
such observations is the disagreement we find among astronomers in
assigning
the places, I shall say not merely of novas and of comets, but of the
fixed
stars themselves, and even of polar altitudes, about which they
disagree
most of the time by many minutes.
      </p>
      <p>As a matter of fact, how would you expect anyone to be sure,
with a
quadrant or sextant that customarily has an arm three or four yards
long,
that he is not out by two or three minutes in the setting of the
perpendicular
or the alignment of the alidade? <font size="-1">(note: An instrument
for
angular measurements.)</font> For on such a circumference this will be
no more than the thickness of a millet seed. Besides which, it is
almost
impossible for the instrument to be constructed absolutely accurate and
then maintained so. Ptolemy distrusted an armillary instrument
constructed
by Archimedes himself for determining the entry of the sun into the
equinox.
      </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> But if the instruments are thus suspect, and the
observations
are so dubious, how can we ever safely accept them and free them from
error?
I have heard great vauntings of Tycho's instruments, which were made at
enormous expense, and of his remarkable skill in making observations.
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> I grant you all this, but neither the one fact
nor the
other suffices to make us certain in affairs of such importance. I want
to have us use instruments far larger than those of Tycho's; quite
precise
ones, and made at minimum cost, whose sides will be four, six, twenty,
thirty, or fifty miles, so that a degree is a mile wide, a minute is
fifty
yards, and a second is little less than a yard. In a word, we may have
them as large as we please, without their costing us a thing.
      </p>
      <p>Being at a villa of mine near Florence, I plainly observed the
arrival
of the sun at the summer solstice and its subsequent departure. For one
evening at its setting it hid itself behind a cliff in the Pietrapana
Mountains,
about sixty miles away, leaving only a small shred of itself revealed
to
the north, the breadth of which was not the hundredth part of its
diameter.
But the following evening, at the same position of setting, it left a
like
part of itself showing which was noticeably thinner. This is a
conclusive
proof that it had commenced to move away from the tropic; yet the sun's
return between the first and second observations surely did not amount
to one second of arc along the horizon. Making the observation later
with
a fine telescope which would multiply the disc of the sun more than a
thousandfold
turned out to be pleasant and easy.
      </p>
      <p>Now my idea is for us to make our observations of the fixed
stars with
similar instruments, utilizing some star in which the changes would be
conspicuous. These are, as I have already explained, the ones which are
farthest from the ecliptic. Among them Vega, a very large star close to
the pole of the ecliptic, would be the most convenient when operating
in
the manner I am about to describe to you, so far as the more northern
countries
are concerned, though I am going to make use of another star. I have
already
been looking by myself for a place well adapted for such observations.
The place Is an open plain, above which there rises to the north a very
prominent mountain, at the summit of which is built a little chapel
facing
west and east, so that the ridgepole of its roof may cut at right
angles
the meridian over some house situated in the plain. I wish to affix a
beam
parallel to that ridgepole and about a yard above it. This done, I
shall
seek in the plain that place from which one of the stars of the Big
Dipper
is hidden by this beam which I have placed, just when the star crosses
the meridian. Or else, if the beam is not large enough to hide the
star,
I shall find the place from which the disc of the star is seen to be
cut
in half by the beam--an effect which can be discerned perfectly by
means
of a fine telescope. It will be very convenient if there happens to be
some house at the place from which this event can be perceived, but if
not, then I shall drive a stick firmly into the ground and affix a mark
to indicate where the eye is to be placed whenever the observation is
to
be repeated. I shall make the first of these observations at the summer
solstice, in order to continue them from month to month, or whenever I
please, until the other solstice.
      </p>
      <p>By means of such observations, the star's rising or lowering
can be
perceived no matter how small it may be. And if in the course of these
operations any such variation shall happen to become known, how great
an
achievement will be made in astronomy' For by this means, besides
ascertaining
the annual motion, we shall be able to gain a knowledge of the size and
distance of that same star.
      </p>
      <p><b>SAGR.</b> I thoroughly understand the whole procedure, and
the operations
seem to me to be so easy and so well adapted to what is wanted, that it
may very reasonably be believed that Copernicus himself, or some other
astronomer, has actually performed them.
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> It seems the other way around to me, for it is
improbable
that if anyone had tried this he would not have mentioned the result,
whichever
opinion it turned out to favor. But no one is known to have availed
himself
of this method, for the above or for any other purpose; and without a
fine
telescope it could not very well be put into effect.
      </p>
      <p><b>SAGR.</b> What you say completely satisfies me. Now, since
quite
a while remains until the night, if you want me to find any rest then,
I hope it will not be too much trouble for you to explain to us those
problems
which a little while ago you asked us to put off until tomorrow. Please
give us back the reprieve which we extended to you, and abandoning all
other arguments explain to us how (assuming the motions which
Copernicus
attributes to the earth, and keeping immovable the sun and the fixed
stars)
such events may follow as pertain to the elevation and lowering of the
sun, the changing of the seasons, and the inequalities of nights and
days,
in Just the way that is so easily understood to take place in the
Ptolemaic
system.
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> I must not and cannot refuse anything which
Sagredo pleads
for. The delay that I requested was only to give me time to rearrange
in
my mind the premises which are useful for a clear and comprehensive
explanation
of the manner in which these events take place in the Copernican as
well
as in the Ptolemaic system. Indeed, more easily and simply in the
former
than in the latter, so that it may be clearly seen that the former
hypothesis
is as easy for nature to put into effect as it is hard for the
intellect
to comprehend. Nevertheless I hope, by utilizing explanations other
than
those resorted to by Copernicus, to make even the learning of it very
much
less obscure. In order to do this, I shall set forth some assumptions
as
known and self-evident, as follows:
      </p>
      <p>First. I assume that the earth is a spherical body which
rotates about
its own axis and poles, and that every point on its surface traces out
the circumference of a circle, greater or lesser according as the
designated
point is more or less distant from the poles. Of these circles, that
one
is greatest which is traced out by a point equidistant from the poles.
All these circles are parallel to one another, and we shall refer to
them
as <i>parallels</i>.
      </p>
      <p>Second. The earth being spherical in shape and its material
being opaque,
half its surface is continually lighted and the rest is dark. The
boundary
which separates the lighted part from the dark being a great circle, we
shall call this the boundary circle of light.
      </p>
      <p>Third. When the boundary circle of light passes through the
earth's
poles It will cut all the parallels into equal sections, it being a
great
circle; but, not passing through the poles, it will cut them all into
unequal
parts except the central circle; this, being also a great circle, will
be cut into equal parts in any case.
      </p>
      <p>Fourth. Since the earth turns about its own poles, the length
of day
and night is determined by the arcs of the parallels cut by the
boundary
circle of light. The arc which remains in the illuminated hemisphere
determines
the length of the day, and the remainder that of the night.
      </p>
      <p>These things being set forth, we may wish to draw a diagram
for a clearer
understanding of what comes next. (Fig. 6) First let us indicate the
circumference
of a circle, to represent for us the orbit of the earth, described in
the
plane of the ecliptic. This we may divide by two diameters into four
equal
parts; Capricorn, Cancer, Libra, and Aries, which shall here represent
at the same time the four cardinal points; that is, the two solstices
and
the two equinoxes. And in the center of this circle, let us denote the
sun, O, fixed and immovable
      </p>
      <center>
      <p><img src="7.3.fig6.gif" alt="" hspace="10" vspace="10"
 border="0" width="262" height="276"></p>
      </center>
      <p>Now with the four points Capricorn, Cancer, Libra, and Aries
as centers,
we shall draw four equal circles which to us will represent the earth
at
these four different seasons. The center of the earth travels in the
space
of a year around the whole circumference Capricorn-Aries-Cancer Libra,<font
 size="-1">)</font>
moving from west to east in the order of the signs of the zodiac. It is
already evident that when the earth is in Capricorn the sun Will appear
in Cancer, the earth moving along the arc from
      </p>
      <p>Capricorn to Aries, the sun will appear to be moving along the
arc from
Cancer to Libra. In a word, it will run through the signs of the zodiac
in their order during the space of a year. So with this first
assumption,
the apparent annual motion of the sun around the ecliptic is satisfied
beyond any argument.
      </p>
      <p>Coming now to the other movement-that is, the diurnal motion
of the
earth about itself--its poles and axis must be established. These must
be understood to be not perpendicularly erect to the plane of the
ecliptic;
that is, not parallel to the axis of the earth's orbit, but inclined
from
right angles about twenty-three and one-half degrees, with the North
Pole
toward the axis of the earth's orbit when the center of the earth is at
the solstitial point in Capricorn Assuming, then, that the center of
the
terrestrial globe Is at that point, let us indicate the poles and the
axis
AB, tilted twenty-three and one-half degrees from the perpendicular on
the Capricorn-Cancer diameter, so that the angle A-Capricorn-Cancer
amounts
to the complement, or sixty-six and one-half degrees, and this
inclination
must be assumed to be immutable. We shall take the upper pole, A, to be
the north, and the other, B, the south.
      </p>
      <p>If the earth is assumed to revolve about its axis AB in
twenty-four
hours, also from west to east, circles parallel to one another will be
described by all points noted on its surface. In this first position of
the earth, we shall designate the great circle CD and the two which are
twenty-three and one-half degrees from it--EF above, and GN below--and
these others at the two extremes, 1K and LM, at a similar distance from
the poles A and B; and we could have drawn countless other circles
parallel
to these five, traced by innumerable points on the earth. Let us now
assume
that the earth is transported by the annual motion of its center to the
other positions already marked, passing to them according to the
following
laws: That its own axis AB not only does not change its inclination to
the plane of the ecliptic, but that it does not vary its direction,
either;
remaining thus always parallel to itself, it points continually toward
the same parts of the universe, or let us say of the firmament. This
means
that if we imagine the axis to be prolonged, it would describe with its
upper end a circle parallel and equal to the earth' s orbit through
Libra,
Capricorn, Aries, and Cancer, as the upper base of a cylinder described
by itself in its annual motion upon the lower base,
Libra-Capricorn-Aries-Cancer.
Hence, because of this unchanging tilt, let us draw these other three
figures
around the centers of Aries, Cancer, and Libra, exactly similar to the
one drawn around the center of Capricorn.
      </p>
      <p>Next let us consider the first diagram of the earth. Because
of the
axis AB being inclined at twenty-three and one-half degrees toward the
sun, and since the arc Al is also twenty-three and one-half degrees,
the
light of the sun illumines the hemisphere of the terrestrial globe
exposed
to the sun (of which only half is seen here), divided from the dark
part
by the boundary of light, IM The parallel CD, being a great circle,
will
be divided into equal parts by this, but all others will be cut into
unequal
parts because the boundary of light W does not pass through the poles A
and B. The parallel IK together with all others described between it
and
the pole A, will be entirely within the illuminated part, just as on
the
other hand the opposite ones toward the pole B and contained within the
parallel LM will remain in the dark.
      </p>
      <p>Besides this, since the arc Al is equal to the arc FD, and the
arc AF
is common to IKF and AFD, the latter two are equal, each being one
quadrant;
and since the whole arc IFM is a semicircle, the arc MF will also be a
quadrant and equal to FKI. Hence the sun, 0, in this position of the
earth,
will be vertical to anyone. at the point F. But through the diurnal
revolution
around the fixed axis AB, all points on the parallel EF pass through
this
same point F, and therefore on such a day the sun at midday will be
overhead
to all inhabitants of the parallel EF; and to them it will seem to
describe
by its motion that circle which we call the tropic of Cancer.
      </p>
      <p>But to the inhabitants of all parallels above the parallel EF
toward
the North Pole, A, the sun is below their zenith toward the south. On
the
other hand, to all inhabitants of the parallels below EF toward the
equator
CID and the South Pole B, the midday sun is elevated above the zenith
toward
the North Pole, A.
      </p>
      <p>Next you may see how of all parallels, only the great circle
CD is cut
into equal parts by the boundary of light IM, the others above and
below
this all being cut into unequal parts. Of the upper ones, the
semidiurnal
arcs (which are those in the part of the earth lighted by the sun) are
greater than the seminocturnal ones, which remain in the dark. The
contrary
happens for the remainder which are beneath the great circle CD toward
the pole B; of these, the semidiurnal arcs are smaller than the
seminocturnal.
Also you may see quite plainly that the differences of these arcs go on
increasing as the parallels become closer to the poles, until the
parallel
IK stays entirely in the lighted part, and its inhabitants have a
twenty-four-hour
day without night. In contrast to this the parallel LM, remaining all
in
the dark, has a night of twenty-four hours without day.
      </p>
      <p>Next let us proceed to the third diagram of the earth, here
placed with
its center at the Cancer point, from which the sun would appear to be
at
the first point of Capricorn. It Is indeed easy to see that as the axis
AB has not changed its tilt, but has remained parallel to itself, the
appearance
and situation of the earth are precisely the same as in the first
diagram,
except that the hemisphere which in the first was lighted by the sun
remains
in shadow here, and the one which was previously dark now becomes
illuminated.
Hence what occurred in the first diagram is now reversed with respect
to
the differences of days and nights and their relative length or
shortness.
      </p>
      <p>The first thing noticed is that where in the first figure, the
circle
1K was entirely in the light it is now all in the dark; and LM, which
opposite,
is now entirely in the light, where it was previously completely in
shadow.
Of the parallels between the great circle CD and the pole A, the
semidiurnal
arcs are now smaller than the seminocturnal, which is the opposite of
the
first; and of the others toward the pole B, the semidiurnal arcs are
now
longer than the seminocturnal, likewise the opposite of What took place
in the other position of the earth. You may now see the sun made
vertical
to the inhabitants of the tropic GN, and for those of the parallel EF
it
is depressed southward through the entire arc ECG; that is, forty-seven
degrees. It has, in short, gone from one tropic to the other, passing
through
the equator, being raised and then dropped along the meridian through
the
said interval of forty-seven degrees. This entire change has its origin
not in any dropping or rising of the earth; on the contrary, in its
never
dropping nor rising, but in generally keeping itself always in the same
location with respect to the universe and merely going around the sun,
which is situated at the center of this same plane in which the earth
moves
around it in the annual motion.
      </p>
      <p>Here a remarkable phenomenon must be noticed, which is that
just as
the preservation of the axis of the earth in the same direction with
respect
to the universe (or let us say toward the highest fixed stars) makes
the
sun appear to us to rise and fall by as much as forty-seven degrees
without
any rise or drop in the fixed stars at all, so if on the contrary the
earth's
axis were continually kept at a given inclination toward the sun (or we
might say toward the axis of the zodiac), no alteration of ascent or
descent
would appear to be made by the sun. Thus the inhabitants of a given
place
would always have the same periods of night and day, and the same kind
or season; that is, some people would always have Writer, some always
summer,
some spring, etc. But on the other hand, the changes in the fixed stars
with regard to rising and falling would then appear enormous to us,
amounting
to this same forty-seven degrees. For an understanding of this let us
go
back to a consideration of the position of the earth in the first
diagram,
where the axis AB is seen with its upper pole A tilted toward the sun.
In the third figure the same axis has kept the same direction toward
the
highest sphere by remaining parallel to itself, so the upper pole A no
longer tilts toward the sun but tilts away from it, and lies
forty-seven
degrees from its first position. Thus, in order to reproduce the same
inclination
of the pole A toward the sun, it would be required (by turning the
globe
along its circumference ACBD) to take it forty-seven degrees toward E;
and any Fixed star observed on the meridian would be raised or lowered
by that many degrees. Now let us proceed with an explanation of the
rest,
and consider the earth placed in the fourth diagram with its center at
the first point of Libra, the sun appearing in the beginning of Aries.
Thus the earth's axis, which in the first diagram was assumed to be
inclined
to the Capricorn-Cancer diameter and hence to be in the same plane as
that
which cuts the earth's orbit perpendicularly in the Capricorn-Cancer
line,
when transferred to the fourth figure (being kept always parallel to
itself,
as we have said), comes to be in a plane which is likewise vertical to
the plane of the earth's orbit, and parallel to the one which cuts the
latter at right angles along the Capricorn-Cancer diameter. Hence the
line
from the center of the sun to the center of the earth (from 0 to Libra)
Will be perpendicular to the axis BA. But this same line from the
center
of the sun to the center of the earth is always perpendicular also to
the
boundary circle of light; therefore this same circle will pass through
the poles A and B in the fourth figure, and the axis AB will lie in its
plane. But the great circle, passing through the poles of the
parallels,
will divide them all into equal parts, therefore the arcs IK EF, CD,
GN,
and LM will all be semicircles, and the lighted hemisphere will be this
one which faces us and the sun, and the boundary circle of light will
be
this very circumference ACBD. And when the earth is at this place, the
equinox will occur for all its inhabitants.
      </p>
      <p>The same Will happen in the second diagram, where the earth
having its
lighted hemisphere toward the sun shows to us its dark side with the
nocturnal
arcs. These are also all semicircles, and consequently also make an
equinox.
Finally, since the line produced from the center of the sun to the
center
of the earth is perpendicular to the axis AB, to which likewise the
great
circle CD among the parallels is perpendicular, the same line O--Libra
necessarily passes through the same plane as the parallel CD, cutting
its
circumference in the center of the daytime arc CD; therefore the sun
will
be vertical to anyone located in that cut. But all inhabitants of that
parallel pass by there, carried by the earth's rotation, and have the
midday
sun directly overhead; therefore the sun will appear to all inhabitants
of the earth to be tracing out the greatest parallel, called the
equatorial
circle.
      </p>
      <p>Moreover, the earth being at either of the solstitial points,
one of
the polar circles IK or LM is entirely in the light and the other in
the
shadow; but when the earth is at the equinoctial points, half of each
of
these polar circles is in the light and the balance in the dark. It
should
not be hard to see how the earth in passing, for example, from Cancer
(where
the parallel IK is entirely dark) to Leo, a part of the parallel IK
toward
the point I will commence to enter the light, and the boundary of light
IM will begin to retreat toward the poles A and B, cutting the circle
ACBD
no longer at I and M, but in two other points failing between the
endpoints
I, A, M, and B, of the arcs IA and MB. Thus the inhabitants of the
circle
IK begin to enjoy the light, and those of the circle LM to experience
the
darkness.

      <p>See, then, how two simple noncontradictory motions assigned to
the earth,
performed in periods well suited to their sizes, and also conducted
from
west to east as in the case of all movable world bodies, supply
adequate
causes for all the visible phenomena. These phenomena can be reconciled
with a fixed earth only by renouncing all the symmetry that is seen
among
the speeds and sizes of moving bodies, and attributing an inconceivable
velocity to an enormous sphere beyond all the others, while lesser
spheres
move very slowly. Besides, one must make the motion of the former
contrary
to that of the latter, and to increase the improbability, must have the
highest sphere transport all the lower ones opposite to their own
inclination.
I leave it to your judgment which has the more likelihood in it.

      <p><b>SAGR.</b> For my part, so far as my senses are concerned,
there is
a great difference between the simplicity and ease of effecting results
by the means given in this new arrangement and the multiplicity,
confusion,
and difficulty found in the ancient and generally accepted one. For if
the universe were ordered according to such a multiplicity, one would
have
to remove from philosophy many axioms commonly adopted by all
philosophers.
Thus it is said that Nature does not multiply things unnecessarily;
that
she makes use of the easiest and simplest means for producing her
effects;
that she does nothing in vain, and the like.
      </p>
      <p>I must confess that I have not heard anything more admirable
than this,
nor can I believe that the human mind has ever penetrated into subtler
speculations. I do not know how it looks to Simplicio.
      </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> If I must tell you frankly how it looks to me,
these appear
to me to me some of those geometrical subtleties which Aristotle
reprehended
in Plato when he accused him of departing from sound philosophy by too
much study of geometry. I have known some very great Peripatetic
philosophers,
and heard them advise their pupils against the study of mathematics as
something which makes the intellect sophistical and inept for true
philosophizing;
a doctrine diametrically opposed to that of Plato, who would admit no
one
into philosophy who had not first mastered geometry.
      </p>
      <p><b>SALV.</b> I endorse the policy of these Peripatetics of
yours in
dissuading their disciples from the study of geometry, since there is
no
art better suited for the disclosure of their fallacies. You see how
different
they are from the mathematical philosophers, who much prefer dealing
with
those who are well informed about the general &lt;--The Third Day
81--&gt;
Peripatetic philosophy than with those who lack such information and
because
of that deficiency are unable to make comparisons between one doctrine
and the other.
      </p>
      <p>But setting all this aside, please tell me what absurdities or
excessive
subtleties make this Copernican arrangement the less plausible so far
as
you are concerned.
      </p>
      <p><b>SIMP.</b> As a matter of fact, I did not completely
understand it,
perhaps because I am not very well versed either in the way the same
effects
are produced by Ptolemy--I mean these planetary stoppings, retrograde
movements,
approaches and retreats, lengthenings and shortenings of the day,
alterations
of the seasons, etc. But passing over the consequences which stem from
the basic assumptions, I feel no small difficulties to exist in these
assumptions
themselves, and if the assumptions fall to the ground then they bring
the
whole structure into ruin. Now since the whole framework of Copernicus
seems to me to be built upon a weak foundation (being supported upon
the
mobility of the earth), then if this were removed, there would be no
room
for further argument. And to remove it, Aristotle's axiom that to a
simple
body only one simple motion can be natural appears to be sufficient.
Here
three movements, if not four, are assigned to the earth, a simple body;
and all of them are quite different from one another. For besides the
straight
motion toward the center, which cannot be denied to it as a heavy body,
there are ascribed to it a circular motion in a great circle around the
sun in one year, and a whirling upon itself every twenty-four hours,
and
(what is most extreme, and possibly for that reason you have remained
silent
about this) another whirling about its own center, completed in a year,
and opposite to the previously mentioned twenty-four-hour motion. My
mind
feels a great repugnance to this....<br>
